    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The Department screen is
        displayed from Departments either by clicking the 'New' button
        or by selecting a department and clicking the 'Modify' button.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The first field is the
        department description, a field that is capitalised after
        stepping on with the Tab key. Next is a tax drop-down box.
        Choose the default tax for this department using the arrow keys.
        Tab to the next field and select the default supplier for goods
        in this department. The next field, 'Default margin', is the
        expected percentage on return (por) for this range of goods. The
        default minimum specifies a minimum stock level, but leave this
        as zero for best use of the system.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Restriction is either an age,
        say 18 for alcohol, or the letter P for pharmacist permission
        with UK law. Click the OK button to accept the new or changed
        department or use the Escape key to dismiss the screen.</span></p>
