<a name="Introduction"></a><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Welcome to the world of EPOS (Electronics at the Point Of Sale), or just plain old POS in the USA.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Most retailers will have considered EPOS as an essential step towards an efficient, controlled retail operation. The next decision then is to decide which system. On thinking about priorities, help and maintenance will undoubtedly figure prominently. Cost, although an important consideration, is rarely a deciding factor.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Why then, do so many people choose ProffittCenter? There is no simple answer. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">If you just want a buy it and forget it EPOS, then buying your preferred wholesaler's choice will seem to suit your needs perfectly. Integration with the wholesaler's head office, twenty four hour support and a helpful team that will set up your product file and do an initial stock take. Of course this service is necessarily expensive, but why not? What have you to loose? </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Well cash! The only reason to install EPOS is to make more of it. Even if you are only thinking of saving time, this will equate to money saved. The hard fact is that to save money, and to make more money with EPOS, you have to invest your own time as well as your own money. Lots of it.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">So the buy it and forget approach without the full commitment of the owner, will necessarily fail. It will cost them money, instead of making any. Maintaining the accuracy of you database will have to become your major concern from the moment you bring EPOS into your store. How is this different with ProffittCenter and a more go-it-alone approach? Well, you will spend more time getting to grips with your system, but ultimately, this is time well spent. The better your understanding of the program, the greater the benefits. So explore the help files diligently, making sure that you understand every procedure. Clean up erroneous data as soon as you spot it. Regularly keep backups and learn how to repair database errors. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Help is still available, both by email at </span><span class="rvts11">proffittcenter@gmail.com</span><span class="rvts10"> and on the phone at (UK) 01795 581467. The support group at </span><span class="rvts12">http://www.proffittcenter.org</span><span class="rvts9"> (just click on Forums) can also be an important resource, both for answering new problems, and for scanning past problems and their solutions.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">ProffittCenter has an enviable reputation of responding to retailer's wishes. It is the core of a community of retailers. Retailers who have made the investment in time and are now benefiting from it. Retailers who are thinking like you, but acted sooner; so why not make a start and join them today.</span></p>

<a name="Whatisabarcode"></a><h2>What is a barcode?</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">A barcode is simply a way of encoding characters in a simple machine readable format of black bars, normally printed onto a white background. The characters encoded may be just numbers or both letters and numbers. There are a variety of different codes used to translate between the characters and the black and white bands. These codes are generally known as symbologies. Products in a supermarket are universally coded with an EAN13 or EAN8 symbology. EAN is for the European Article Numbering Association, and the 13 or 8 refers to the number of digits (numbers only) encoded. In America, the equivalent standard is UPC for Universal Product Code and is broadly similar. EAN13 codes can also have an extension code added. These are commonly used for issue identification with magazines.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Bars in the code are distinguished by their width; normally a choice is made between two widths, one unit or two units wide. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">There are a large number of other codes available, but the main additional one of interest is Code 39. This is used by this program for any bar codes that are printed out. These are printed with a free bar code font provided by Bar Codes, Inc. at </span><span class="rvts11">http://www.barcodesinc.com/free-barcode-font/</span><span class="rvts10"> . You are free to use these fonts in other applications. For instance, you might wish to generate bar code labels with a spread sheet program, such as Excel. Any number represented in Code 39 needs to have a * character both before and after the number as start and stop codes. That is, if you want a number 1003456, you need to have the string of characters *1003456* printed in the Code 39 font. To see how this works, </span><span class="rvts13">*1003456* </span><span class="rvts10">is the same string in the Code 39 font. These need to be printed with a high quality printer; ideally a high resolution laser printer, although success can be achieved with an ink jet printer. A dot matrix printer is not suitable.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">It is common practice to print the number that is coded below the actual bar code as this makes it possible to enter a code manually if the scanner fails to read it successfully.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The machine readable part is satisfied by an optical system together with a unit that converts light signals into an electrical signal. There are two main ways of doing this. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The bar code can be illuminated, and then an image of the bar code is converted by a device that is similar in principle to a video camera, except that it only scans a single line, instead of a rectangular area. These sensors are based on CCD (charge coupled device) technology and hence the scanners based on them are known as CCD scanners. The illumination is provided by a set or LEDs (light emitting diodes) and such scanners are often recognised by the pulsing red light that they give off. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The other approach used is to scan the barcode with an intense, collimated moving beam of light, and to detect the reflected light with a simple photo-detector. The intense beam of light is provided by a solid state visible laser, normally red. These devices are robust and have a long life. The power in the light beam is insufficient to cause eye damage, although looking into the beam is not without risk. The effective intensity is high because the laser light is monochromatic, allowing much of the ambient light to be removed by a simple filter before detection. The beam is scanned with a mechanical system of rotating or nutating mirrors, either along a straight line, or in a complex two dimensional pattern for an omni-directional scanner. The use of a mechanical system makes such scanners less rugged overall, but they have the advantage of high readability and fast acquisition. They can read bar codes at a distance, including the larger case codes, and are far less dependent upon the actual distance that the bar code is from the scanner, as image focusing is not involved. Most types will scan continuously or will start scanning when presented with an object at the scanning aperture, allowing hands-free operation. They are generally the preferred option for retail use, but are not the cheapest option. They can be recognised by the sharp red line, or pattern of lines, emitted when in operation.</span></p>

<a name="Whyfreesoftware"></a><h2>Why free software?</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Common questions asked are "Why is the software free?" and "If the software is really free, what guarantees do I get?"</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The software is free because it was originally written just for use in our own small shop, and then we offered it to other retailers to let them share in the benefits, without any immediate thought of profit. For this, the program had to be slowly upgraded to a more professional standard with such extras as full help files, installation routines, etc. Distribution led to the need for a web site. The costs involved have meant creating a business around the product, making a profit from the sale of hardware. We hope that you will purchase the hardware from us so that we can continue to provide the service, but it is not required that you purchase anything to use the program.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The guarantees provided with commercial software are strictly limited. All software licenses attempt to take away the right to a refund in any circumstances and accept no liability for consequential damage. New enhanced versions are normally charged for at the full, or a substantial upgrade cost.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Most, but not all, firms will offer installation support for a limited period. After that, all support is charged for, normally on an annual basis. If for any reason a firm stops trading, or sometimes if it just drops the product line, any support will normally cease.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The guarantee supplied with free software under the GPL license makes no additional promises, but at least you are assured of your money back if it is not suitable! The license also provides for access to the source code. This can mean that support can continue, even if the supplier ceases to provide it, provided that others take up the programming challenge. This has happened with other software products released under the same license, and I strongly hope that it will eventually happen with ProffittCenter. Upgrades, whether small bug fixes or substantially enhanced versions will always be free to download. This in turn means that support only has to be tailored to the latest download.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">We do provide free e-mail support at </span><span class="rvts14">proffittcenter@gmail.com</span><span class="rvts9"> for all users of the program. This has been a helpful form of feedback for us and has led to many improvements being made to the program. Coping with the flow of e-mails has not been a problem to date. In fact, the numbers of e-mails has decreased, as initial problems have been ironed out.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">We now have a web based discussion group, at www.proffittcenter.org , (just click on Forums on the website) so post your questions there or browse the answers to other people's questions. Subsequently you can all lend a hand in helping newcomers overcome their initial hurdles.</span></p>

<a name="Licence"></a><h2>Licence</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">ProffittCenter is released under the GPL or Open Source licence. This means that you are free to copy the program and distribute it as long as you include the source code, or make this available to a third party. The same applies if you modify the program. You may not release the program or a modified program under a more restrictive licence.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The help files are copyright, but the original distribution includes this. This means that you are free to use and distribute the help files, but may not derive other works from them, such as printed manuals, without permission of the author.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The full terms of the GPL licence are given below. You will be asked to agree to its terms when you install the program.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The Open Source Definition, Version 1.0</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Open source doesn't just mean access to the source code. The distribution terms of an open-source program must comply with the following criteria:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Free Redistribution </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The license may not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. The license may not require a royalty or other fee for such sale. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Source Code </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form. Where some form of a product is not distributed with source code, there must be a well-publicized means of downloading the source code, without charge, via the Internet. The source code must be the preferred form in which a programmer would modify the program. Deliberately obfuscated source code is not allowed. Intermediate forms such as the output of a preprocessor or translator are not allowed. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Derived Works </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software. (rationale)</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Integrity of the Author's Source Code </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The license may restrict source code from being distributed in modified form only if the license allows the distribution of "patch files" with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time. The license must explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified source code. The license may require derived works to carry a different name or version number from the original software. (rationale)</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons. (rationale)</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research. (rationale)</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Distribution of License </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties. (rationale)</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">License Must Not Be Specific to a Product </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's being part of a particular software distribution. If the program is extracted from that distribution and used or distributed within the terms of the program's license, all parties to whom the program is redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the original software distribution. (rationale)</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">License Must Not Contaminate Other Software </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software. For example, the license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be open-source software. (rationale)</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Example Licenses </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The GNU GPL, BSD, X Consortium, and Artistic licenses are examples of licenses that we consider conformant to the Open Source Definition. So is the MPL.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Bruce Perens wrote the first draft of this document as "The Debian Free Software Guidelines," and refined it using the comments of the Debian developers in a month-long email conference in June, 1997. He removed the Debian-specific references from the document to create the "Open Source Definition."</span></p>

<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Version 2, June 1991</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place--Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Preamble</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you". </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licencees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">NO WARRANTY</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">One line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does. Copyright (C) 19yy name of author</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.</span></p>

<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type "show w". This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type "show c" for details.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The hypothetical commands "show w" and "show c" should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than "show w" and "show c"; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.</span></p>

<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs.

<a name="Internationalisation"></a><h2>Internationalisation</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Some effort has been made to internationalise ProffittCenter. The currency symbols are set in the Settings screen. Note that there is a symbol or symbols for the main currency such as £ in the UK and also one for the penny (in the UK). (That is, in the USA $ and c.) Unfortunately, ProffittCenter will not work for very low value currencies as the maximum cash tender is £15000 ($15000 etc.).</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The text in all of the screens and in messages can be changed. Contact ProffittCenter if you wish to help with this.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Finally, there is the use of English in help files. This is unlikely to change without international help in re-writing them. This would be a much bigger job.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">We hope that this does not put you off from trying out the program. We currently have registered users in Ireland, Netherlands, USA, Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Norway and many more. We would love to increase this list.</span></p>

<a name="Taxregimes"></a><h2>Tax regimes</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">ProffittCenter is in use throughout the world. To ensure compatibility with the differing tax regimes in use, it is necessary to look at how different sales taxes are levied, and to set up ProffittCenter accordingly. The tax regime in use is specified in the &nbsp;screen. Before rushing to choose an appropriate setting, please note that in the absence of any sales taxes, it is still necessary to specify a zero rated tax to apply to all products. The options for tax regime fall into two groups: the simpler sales taxes, and the various value added tax formats. We will explain these separately below.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts15">No tax: </span><span class="rvts10">this setting is selected when the country of use has no sales taxes. Leave a record for one sale tax of zero for filling in the stock record for every product and another for rentals, or service charges, again with a zero rate.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts15">Sales tax:</span><span class="rvts10"> this setting is used for countries for a sales tax levied on all retail sales. The assumption is that wholesale supplies will have no tax levied. Set up one tax record with the desired rate. If there are any exempt products, then a separate zero rate is required. The tax is applied to a complete bill as a separate charge. All product prices exclude this tax. The net takings figure will include all sales but will exclude any sales taxes.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts15">VAT:</span><span class="rvts10"> This is value added tax, used in the European Union. It differs from a sales tax because the tax is applied to supplies at wholesale price, and this tax paid may then be offset against the tax charged on goods sold. The tax is thus charged on the addition cost of goods, that is the added value. There are three separate cases to consider. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts15">Registered trader: </span><span class="rvts10">The normal situation of a registered trader, who charges the correct tax on all of their sales but the retail price of items includes these taxes. The net tax is not displayed to the customer, and is not shown on the receipt. Product prices include any tax due, but net takings exclude these taxes.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts15">Unregistered trader: </span><span class="rvts10">traders whose annual turnover is less than some specified amount do not have to collect VAT. As they still have to pay VAT on their purchases, and cannot reclaim this element, not all tax is lost to their government. In ProffittCenter it is necessary to set the correct tax code for each product, so that the correct prices are recorded for wholesale prices, and margins, etc.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts15">Registered wholesale trader:</span><span class="rvts10"> these are registered traders with a main customer base are other registered traders. Prices of goods are always shown exclusive of VAT, and the tax due is shown on the screen and on any receipt. Product prices are recorded exclusive of VAT. The net takings figure excludes tax.</span></p>

<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The keyboard should be set up with Caps Lock off and the Num Lock on. The screen should be set to a resolution of 1280x1024 pixels for optimum layout. On starting off, log in as the default operator. The correct code will appear in the data entry box at start-up. Type in your own operator code, when you have one, followed by the enter key. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">You are now ready to start selling!</span></p>

<a name="Startingoff"></a><h2>Starting off</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Initially, a blank database will be installed. Log in and use the number '10000370000' as a password.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">First enter the required entries in the </span><a class="rvts16" href="#Settings">Settings</a><span class="rvts9"> screen. Then set up the operators of the system. It would be better to give users higher numbers and incorporate these into bar-coded passes. When this has been done, the initial operator can be downgraded to trainee, but make sure that at least one operator has an authority of zero.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The menu selection </span><span class="rvts12">File&gt;Print barcodes</span><span class="rvts9"> will print out a set of six bar codes that can be attached to the operator side of the monitor to use for returns, wastes, own use, video member, charged and received on account.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Next, set up the departments to your liking. The existing departments can be deleted or modified provided that no sales have been entered. Retain the Rental department for rentals, and the Temp A and Temp B departments. Another recognized department is Agency. This was used for the receipt of PayPoint monies, but might be used for any money received that does not form part of the trade's takings. Aim for between ten and twenty departments in total. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Finally, the key supplier details should be added to the supplier database.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The system can then be used, but it may be wise to add the most commonly sold products (such as cigarettes and confectionery in a convenience store) first using the </span><a class="rvts16" href="#Startingstock">Starting stock</a><span class="rvts9"> screen. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">For each new product encountered in the </span><a class="rvts16" href="#Salesscreen">Sales screen</a><span class="rvts9">, a description and price have to be entered immediately to complete a sale.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">However, as the department is left at the </span><span class="rvts12">Default</span><span class="rvts9">, the product is considered a temporary product. Later, using the &nbsp;menu item </span><a class="rvts16" href="#Defaultstock">Stock&gt;Default stock</a><span class="rvts9">, the department and stock details are added. These details should include default supplier and default case size. These defaults will be used later to generate the first orders.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">After a few days, new products will be rarer. At this stage, all of the stock details can be added at the point of sale if desired, and if time allows. At this stage, stock taking should be started as a routine activity. Use the menu item </span><a class="rvts16" href="#Stocktake">Stock&gt;Stocktake&gt;All</a><span class="rvts9">. Later, it is preferable to use the alternative, </span><span class="rvts12">Stock&gt;Stocktake&gt;All&lt;10</span><span class="rvts9"> &nbsp;menu selection, as this avoids counting large numbers of items, which tends to introduce more errors than it eliminates.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">After about three weeks, the ordering system can be brought into play.</span></p>

<a name="Settings"></a><h2>Settings</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The Settings screen is reached by activating the menu entry </span><span class="rvts12">File&gt;Settings</span><span class="rvts9"> and requires that the operator has owner or manager privileges. This screen is also displayed at start-up if no database is found. It will normally be the first screen encountered after installing the program. If you have not installed MySQL via XAMPP, freely available from the "Apache Friends" website, then do this first. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The </span><span class="rvts12">Settings</span><span class="rvts9"> screen is divided into three separate tabs: </span><span class="rvts12">server</span><span class="rvts9">, </span><span class="rvts12">hardware</span><span class="rvts9">, and </span><span class="rvts12">shop</span><span class="rvts9">. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The </span><span class="rvts18">Server</span><span class="rvts9"> tab holds all the required settings for connection to a database (MySQL). First there is the server name, the database name, the MySQL user name and password. The default for these are localhost (for a server running on the same computer), till, root and blank. These need to match your own set-up of &nbsp;MySQL. For an on-line database, we have (for example)</span><span class="rvts12"> www.proffittcenter.org, proff2_till, proff2_test</span><span class="rvts9">, and the password, which needs to be entered twice. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts19">The backup Gmail address and Gmail password are for the automatic backing up of the database. Fill in your own Gmail email address (including @gmail.com) and the Gmail account password, and every time the program is closed on the machine with the server running, an email will be sent to your Google email account with an attached sql file. This can subsequently be run to reconstruct the database if something should go wrong. If you do not have a Gmail account they are free from google.com and currently hold 7.5 GB of data. The program will work without this information, but for safety, always back up you data.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts19">The Gmail address can be your normal address, or one specifically created to hold these emails. If it is your normal address, then set up a filter to move these emails directly to a separate backup folder, skipping the in-box. This will ensure that they are archived and thus save some space, as well as keeping your in-box clear.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts20">The above process has now been superseded by the use of Dropbox, a free on-line repository. You can install Dropbox by clicking on the link on the Server tab, and following the instructions. Once installed, backing up is automatic.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts18">It is always necessary to click the 'Test connection' button before the main 'OK' button is enabled. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If an empty database engine is found, additional buttons will be enabled on the Server page to install the database, and then install all the required tables. These must be clicked in turn, before proceeding to the main OK button.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The </span><span class="rvts17">Hardware</span><span class="rvts9"> tab hold values for a specific hardware setup. Select an available port and then click the 'Test' button to see if the connection works. The code table and select font drop down box can be set as required. Here, in the UK, the UK setting, and the Page 19 (PC858 EURO) setting proved useful. Click 'Touch screen' if you want to use that facility. The 'Invoice printer' is for the use of an attached Windows printer instead of a receipt printer. (Not recommended)</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The </span><span class="rvts17">Shop</span><span class="rvts9"> tab hold values specific to a particular shop, such as shop name and address. Note the pound and penny symbols: insert your own for local currency. Select the character set Cp850 for a start. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The tax regime for the UK, the choice is between unregistered (for VAT), registered and wholesale registered. The difference is that for wholesale, selling prices are quoted excluding VAT, and the VAT is added to the total. For retail, VAT is included in each price.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Then, there is a check box 'Receipt always' and 'Print receipt if greater than:'. Check this if you want a receipt to be issued for all transactions, or increase the value from zero if you want printed receipts for larger transactions only. You can always print receipts on demand by &nbsp;pressing the 'Print Screen' key.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts12">Set</span><span class="rvts9"> </span><span class="rvts12">Autoclear in minutes</span><span class="rvts9"> refers to the locking of the sales screen if left for an extended period. Set the value to zero if you do not want this feature.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The 'Float value' allows for a fixed float to be set. Leave this at zero and you will be asked to enter the float for the shift.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Till ID should be zero for the back office, and any low number for sales stations.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Unchecking the </span><a class="rvts16" href="#Newproduct">New product</a><span class="rvts9"> box will disable the creation of new product in the sales screen.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Remember, if changes are made on any page, it is necessary to click the OK button which will save the changed values. The program will then shut down and needs to be re-started.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">To set up with an on-line database, the following may be helpful.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">I use Lunar hosts as my provider, using CPanel.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">In CPanel click on MySQL databases. Then click Create New Database and fill in database name.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Then create a user:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Then add user to the database you created:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">When you click on Add, you get a chance to grant privileges for this user's account:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Having made a note of all the relevant values, go to File&gt;Settings on the Server tab:</span></p>

<a name="Productcodes"></a><h2>Product codes</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">ProffittCenter makes use of a number of special codes, or numbers, to implement functions such as &nbsp;or . A consequence of this is that these numbers may not be used for products. This is no problem if product Bar codes are used, as all legal EAN or UPC Bar codes are acceptable; but it does need to be considered if product codes are created for your own use.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Small numbers, up to 129,999 are interpreted as a cash tender (i.e. £1299.99), so these numbers may not be used. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Ten digit numbers that begin with 1000030 to 1000039 are used internally and should not be allocated as product codes. To allow for some further extensions, this range of restricted numbers should be extended to a maximum of 1000399999.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The numbers 1000001 to 1000026 are interpreted as s, product codes generated by pressing a single character on the keyboard. These are legal codes, but you should be aware of their interpretation.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">See the section on &nbsp;for details of invented bar code for internal use. </span></p>

<a name="Updatingtheprogram"></a><h2>Updating the program</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">ProffittCenter is open source which has the particular advantage that program updates never add to the cost of ownership. This means that you benefit from the constantly improving program and its developments. Installing the latest version will have no effect on the database, which is a separate program (MySQL). &nbsp;Just download the latest version periodically, and then install as you did the first time around. There is no need to uninstall before doing this. The 'jasper' files located in ProffittCenterReports are not overwritten. This is so that you can modify these files using the open source iReport program, and your modifications will not be overwritten. You might need to do this to get a different layout of invoices. If on the other hand, you find one of the reports lacking, just delete the particular jasper files and on install, they will be replaced by the latest version.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">If you email Dave at proffittcenter@gmail.com with a request, he will share a folder in Dropbox that will always hold the latest version of ProffittCenter, ready for you to install.</span></p>

<a name="Choosinghardware"></a><h2>Choosing hardware</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The minimum hardware requirements are a standard PC with a processor speed of 300MHz or greater, with keyboard, monitor, simple sound system and mouse; and a standard ink jet printer, for reports. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">To this, you should add a laser hands free scanner, to read in the bar codes. Choose one with a USB interface. CCD scanners are a cheaper option, but can be tedious to use in practice, as they need to be held at the correct distance from the bar code, and generally require a trigger button to be pressed which precludes hands-free operation. They are also unsuitable for reading the larger case codes used in the </span><a class="rvts16" href="#Deliveryentry">Delivery entry</a><span class="rvts9"> screen.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Most practical situations would require the addition of a receipt printer and cash drawer. We recommend a serial thermal receipt printer, which is fast, quiet and can include an automatic paper cut-off mechanism. Cash drawers attach to an outlet at the back of the receipt printer. An ink jet printer will still be required for reports. A receipt printer is required to print off lists for stock counting.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">A customer pole display is a useful addition. One with </span><span class="rvts12">pass-thru</span><span class="rvts9"> for a serial receipt printer is ideal.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">There is no need to locate and install Windows drivers for your receipt printer or scanner, as they are not used by the program and can interfere with normal operation. Supported printers are selected in the &nbsp;screen, reached from the file menu. Set the printer and pole display to ESC/POS emulation. The drive program is included within the program.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If buying a computer, choose a processor speed of at least 1GHz and with the current low memory prices, at very least 2GB of RAM. A hard disk needs to be at least 20GB and preferably 100GB. A 19-inch LCD monitor is recommended. A CD R/W drive is definitely desirable for backups or a memory stick can be used.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">An Internet connection is needed for updates to the program and for e-mail support or for accessing an on-line database. Future extensions with exciting possibilities may require access to the Internet. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">We can supply extension kits to convert your existing computer or complete turnkey systems, pre-loaded with ProffittCenter for maximum convenience. See the web site at </span><span class="rvts14">www.proffittcenter.org</span><span class="rvts9"> for the latest prices.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The program was developed to run originally on Windows XP but should run on other Windows operating systems. The installer is windows specific. Try WebStart or download the jar file for other operating systems.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">It is hoped to offer a linux version at a later date.</span></p>

<a name="Secondhandequipment"></a><h2>Second-hand equipment</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Having acquired free software, some retailers have built successful systems using only second-hand equipment for the ultimate in a low cost approach. There is little to fault with this approach. Much of the equipment available has years of useful life left, and there is a steady supply of equipment, due to shop closures and liquidations. (EPOS didn't stop them failing!)</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Receipt printers are available with either dot matrix or thermal mechanisms. Dot matrix types are noisier and will occasionally need a new ribbon, whereas thermal printers need special, but readily available paper; but both are usable. Interfaces are currently serial, or parallel, but USB is available on newer units. The program can accept either serial or parallel. USB may present a problem. The program can accept Epson ESC/POS standard. Other widths can be catered for by adjusting the characters to a line setting in the settings screen. Printers are often set up by internal dip switches. To test current settings, press and hold the Form Feed switch while switching on the printer and it should print out a test strip together with information that will show the settings. A printer manual can often be downloaded from the Internet, but in the absence of this, you could try adjusting switch setting by trial and error. A serial printer should be set to 8 bits, no parity, dtr/dsr, 9600 baud and one stop bit. Note that you will require a serial printer cable and not a null modem cable.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Scanners can be keyboard wedge, (a Y-shaped lead that sits between computer and keyboard,) serial, or USB interface. See the &nbsp;on setting up a serial scanner. If the scanner works for your products, fine. If not, you may need to re-program it. First locate the manual on the Internet, and print it. If your scanner is too old to be supported, download a later scanner by the same manufacturer and try using that one. Scanners are programmed by scanning special bar codes printed in their manual. You need to program it to read type 39 codes (or 3of 9) and the various EAN and UPC codes on offer. Default settings are commonly acceptable, but changing such things as inter-character delay can be helpful.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Cash drawers are generally compatible, and plug into the back of the receipt printer. Make sure that you have the correct lead, as they are not too readily available. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">New equipment is also to be recommended. New receipt printers will have a drop in facility for paper; this is very useful if you have a customer waiting for a receipt. ProffittCenter can supply recommended compatible equipment so visit the web site at www.proffittcenter.org for current hardware prices. </span></p>

<a name="Laptops"></a><h2>Laptops</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">A laptop may also be used to run the system. This has the immediate advantage of being able to continue working after a power failure. It also leads to a compact counter-top solution.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">We would recommend a USB scanner and serial printer. A single line scanner should be able to run off the laptop's power supply. The receipt printer will require mains input, but it will be possible to continue working without receipts. A second display may be connected for customer use, mirroring the laptop's screen. This can also be achieved with a television screen with the appropriate connecting leads.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Some changes have been made to accommodate the limited keyboard of a laptop. In particular, the .n instead of *n for a multiplier avoids the use of the shift key. Some users have added a USB numeric keypad for convenience.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">If your laptop lacks a serial port, you can experiment with a USB to serial converter.</span></p>

<a name="Layout"></a><h2>Layout</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">You can arrange the monitor on the counter, at right angles, so that both the sales assistant and the customer can view the sales screen at the same time. This should be to the right of the salesperson, with the standard keyboard positioned on the left. This will ensure that the numeric keypad, with all the most commonly used keys, is easy to reach. The cash drawer can be used as a base on which the monitor and receipt printer can be placed. The laser scanner stand should be attached to the counter adjacent to the cash drawer. The computer, in a tower case, can be placed within the counter, below the cash drawer. The cash drawer is similar in size to a standard cash register.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">It will be necessary to drill some holes for the cables. Typical cable lengths are video: 1.5m, serial receipt printer: 2m, parallel printer cable: up to 3m, scanner: 1m. The connection from the receipt printer to the cash drawer is short ~ 0.5m. The telephone connection can be easily extended to reach the computer with standard telephone extension cables. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">A pole display is advised. We prefer the pass-trough variety. ESC/POS is the standard interface.</span></p>

<a name="Creatinganetwork"></a><h2>Creating a network</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Before networking ProffittCenter, you need to set up a network. With Microsoft XP, this is not difficult, and will not be described here. However, the network should be stable, and you should be able to 'see' any computer from any other computer on the network. If access seems to be blocked, do not forget to check whether any installed firewalls are causing problems. Once you have created a satisfactory network, there are a number of steps that you need to take to set up a fully functioning ProffittCenter network, and these are detailed in the 'Setting up a Network' section of the ProffittCenter Manual (Network Edition)</span></p>

<a name="Settingupanetwork"></a><h2>Setting up a network</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Setting up a network is an extensive subject and I have not come up with a definitive answer. This note is just to relate my own experience.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">1. &nbsp;You need to have a network set up with a router. I have a wireless router supplied by TalkTalk. The server (main computer) is wired in. The router can be reached by typing 192.168.1.1 into the address bar of my &nbsp;browser. Everything left on default settings.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">2. &nbsp;Each computer has an assigned name. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">3. &nbsp;In your firewall, open port 3306 on server on each client machine. This is straightforward in Windows firewall.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">4. &nbsp;On the server, bring up the XAMPP control panel and make sure that MySQL and Apache are both running.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">5. &nbsp;On the server start ProffittCenter Pro and use 'localhost' for server name. The database name is till, the User name is root, and the password is the one you have set.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">6. &nbsp;Make a note of the other computer names. Find these by right clicking on My Computer and selecting Properties.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">7. &nbsp;On the server, log into XAMPP by putting localhost into the address bar of a browser, and then start phpMyAdmin.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">8. Under 'Privileges', create a new User for each other computer, using the computer name as a user name and making a note of the passwords (required).</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">9. Now, in ProffittCenter Pro, on each other computer, under Settings, Make the Server name the computer name of the server, the User name is the name of the current computer, and the password is the one we just created for that user name. The database remains till. Check that you get a connection.</span></p>

<a name="Databases"></a><h2>Databases</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">When starting with an empty database, it is necessary to create some entries before the system is of any use. Products are created on the fly by the sales screen, but if not defined at the time, they are created with the temporary SKU assignment, </span><span class="rvts12">Default</span><span class="rvts9">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">To make record creation simpler, some entries are left in the empty database, such as VAT rates, and Departments. These can be modified, deleted and added to as required, but it is important that this is done before adding stock and product records. Once a record is referred to by one of these, it can no longer be deleted. The Stock database is left with two entries called Default and TempB for temporary assignments to zero rated and standard rated stock. The first entry is required by the system and should never be deleted. The Department database is set up with departments. These can be deleted or modified, but three must remain. These are </span><span class="rvts12">Default</span><span class="rvts9"> and </span><span class="rvts12">Agency</span><span class="rvts9">. </span><span class="rvts12">Agency</span><span class="rvts9"> covers money taken for a third party such as PayPoint.

<a name="Backingup"></a><h2>Backing up</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Facilities are built into ProffittCenter to back up the MySQL database to an on-line server over the Internet every time you shut down ProffittCenter on the computer with the server (mysql database) running on it. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The preferred backing up solution is now provided. Just install the free Dropbox software, and everything will be taken care of. The Dropbox software is available on the Internet - just click on the link in the </span><span class="rvts11">Help</span><span class="rvts10"> menu or on the </span><span class="rvts11">File&gt;Settings &gt;Server</span><span class="rvts10"> tab. Not only is this solution simpler to get working, it is not necessary to wait while a sizeable attachment to an email is sent, when shutting down at the end of a long day. Dropbox will quietly upload the file in the background during the next working day. Files are saved with a name that includes the day of the month, ensuring that only month-old files are overwritten. Earlier versions are available on Dropbox.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts19">In the Settings screen are two entries: Backup email address and Backup password. The backup email address and password are just the values for a gmail account which may be your own or one you have created just to hold your backups. The files will have the name tillDumpxx.sql where xx is the numeric day of the month. Do not switch off your computer until the backing up is complete. This may take some time. Subsequently, a log file of any errors is saved locally in My Documents/ProffittCenter Reports or alternatively in a Dropbox folder. This is not dated, so only one file will be available when you look.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If you ever need to restore the database at any time, download the latest backup file from your gmail account, or from the Dropbox location, and then run the sql file using phpmyadmin, or other database management tool. (I always use the free version of Navicat)</span></p>

The letter i is a . The system will issue an error beep for an unrecognised product. Repeat pressing the letter i followed by the enter key a second time. This time, the wording next to the data entry box changes to 'Enter a description...'. By forcing the operator to enter a code twice, ProffittCenter avoids the creation of a new product when a bar code is only partially read or miss-read. Type in a description of the product you want associated with the letter i, for example 'ice pole', and press the Tab key. Descriptions are automatically capitalised, so that 'ice pole' becomes 'Ice Pole'. The caption changes to 'Enter price in pence ..'. As a general rule, all prices are entered in pence (or your local smallest currency unit, such as cents), just as they would be on a cash register.</span></p>

<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">In all locations where a product bar code is expected, entering three or more characters will bring up the Alpha Lookup screen. For this to work, all characters have to be alphabetic characters. The Alpha Lookup screen will show a list of matching product descriptions. Entering more characters can further restrict the search. It is not necessary to type in the starting characters of the first word, as the match is performed of each word in the product description. So typing bleach may result in a list including </span><span class="rvts12">HS Bleach 1l, HS Thick Bleach 1l, Domestos Bleach 1.5l and Bleach, Value 1l.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Products can be selected with the mouse or by using the up/down arrow keys. The typed description will then be replaced by the product bar code. The last column contains a single digit, 0 to 9. If this digit is pressed, that line will be selected. If there are more than ten lines, the remainder are not numbered.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Each line of the display contains a retail price. This allows for the correct selection of products with identical descriptions but different prices. The next one to the end of the line, after the product description, shows the number in stock. It is often the most convenient way of checking the current stock holding, from the sales screen; useful for answering customer requests. Pressing Escape will abort the lookup, afterwards.

<a name="Pennyitems"></a><h2>Penny items</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Multiple items priced at 1 penny (UK) are treated slightly differently to others. Say we have the key g set as a </span><span class="rvts11">Hotkey</span><span class="rvts10"> for all greengrocery sold, each sold at 1p, and we enter </span><span class="rvts11">g35</span><span class="rvts10"> to indicate that greengrocery worth 35p has been sold. This is then displayed as 1 item at 35p rather than 35 items at 1p. If we subsequently try to modify the number sold, say be pressing the enter key to increase by one, the number sold will increase to two at 35p. This representation is not restricted to hotkeys; any product priced at 1p will be treated the same way. This change was made as customers were sometimes confused by the unmodified display. The use of the penny and the pound in these discussions, does not mean that the facilities are limited to just this currency. ProffittCenter is an international program.</span></p>

<a name="Zeropriceditems"></a><h2>Zero priced items</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Items that have a zero price recorded cause an </span><span class="rvts11">Enter price in pence</span><span class="rvts10"> message to be displayed, when sold. This does not change the price of the product permanently; just the price for this sale. Such items can be used for goods which are counted for stock control, but which do not have a fixed price. Loose cut cheese might be an example. Price encoded bar codes are a better solution, where this is possible. Another example would be live (aquarium) fish which are charged for depending on their size. Barcodes are not practical, here.</span></p>

<a name="Tracking"></a><h2>Tracking</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">In some situations, it is necessary to track the customer name for certain purchased items. An example of this would be the sale of mobile phones, each individually identified by a serial number. If one is later brought back for repair, the customer name can be entered, and the details of the sale recovered, allowing the serial number to be checked, and the date of purchase.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Products to be tracked are distinguished by being in a T in their </span><a class="rvts16" href="#Department">Department restriction</a><span class="rvts10">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">When a tracked product is sold, there is a beep and the customer screen is displayed. If the customer is already on record, the appropriate record is clicked prior to clicking on the OK button, or simply double clicked. If the customer is not on record, clicking the OK button, or pressing the enter key, will bring up the new customer screen, so that details can be entered.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Once this is done, a screen is displayed for entry of the item code, and then the OK button clicked to complete the sale. When the sale is completed, information is stored in the sales table for later use.</span></p>

<a name="Priceandweightencoding"></a><h2>Price and weight encoding</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">There is not a universal standard for price encoded barcodes but it is hoped that what has been implemented will be suitable for most applications. When creating a new product with the </span><a class="rvts16" href="#Newproduct">New product</a><span class="rvts10"> screen, if the barcode </span><span class="rvts11">might </span><span class="rvts10">be a price encoded barcode, there is an drop down box labelled Encoded that can select one of three options:</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 13px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li class="rvps7" style="margin-left: 0; text-indent: 0px"><span class="rvts10">Normal</span></li>
<li class="rvps7" style="margin-left: 0; text-indent: 0px"><span class="rvts10">Price encoded</span></li>
<li class="rvps7" style="margin-left: 0; text-indent: 0px"><span class="rvts10">Weight encoded.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Choose the correct setting and in the case of </span><a class="rvts16" href="#Priceandweightencoding">Weight encoded</a><span class="rvts10">, enter the price per kg in the price box. For </span><a class="rvts16" href="#Priceandweightencoding">Price encoded</a><span class="rvts10">, the price will be set to 0.</span></p>

<a name="Multipacks"></a><h2>Multipacks</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">There is sometimes a need to have multi packs and single packs linked to a single SKU. If this is not done, then it is necessary to book out the multipack and treat the individual items as a fresh delivery each time a multipack is split for resale.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Let us for example consider Stella cans sold singly at £1 each. You could also sell whole cases (24 cans) at £22 a case. The case would be recognised by the case barcode. We are not discussing offers here. The singles and cases are treated as different products being sold at different prices. What we require is for the stock level of Stella cans to be reduced by 24 every time a case is sold.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">This is achieved by changing the multipack quantity from its' default value of 1 to 24 in the New Product dialog. As this makes no sense, unless the product is linked to an existing product, a link must also be made in the SKU drop down box before this can be effected.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Note that when stocktaking, it is now the number of cans of Stella that will be counted, even if cases are listed.</span></p>

<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Product can be restricted either by setting an age limit or by a </span><span class="rvts11">pharmacist only</span><span class="rvts10"> requirement. A restriction is set in place by imposing the restriction on the </span><a class="rvts16" href="#Department">department</a><span class="rvts10"> the product is in. For age restrictions, set the age in the restriction field of the department - i.e. 18 for a minimum age of 18. For pharmacist only put a letter p in the field.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">When a restricted product is sold, a question is asked via the screen, and the operator responds with a 'y' for yes. Any other key press is treated as a no and the sale is not completed.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">If an age related product is sold, the system will not ask again for the same customer.</span></p>

<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The 'I' characters are the item code, and the 'P' characters are the price or weight codes. The 'V' and 'C' are check digits.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">It is not possible to enter such codes at the sales screen like other products, but if such a code is scanned into the 'New product' screen either from delivery or starting stock screens, then there is automatically an additional option available - to choose encoded by weight or by price. When one of these is chosen, the barcode is stripped down to the initial digits and then the rest replaced with zeroes. With price encoded products, the price entry is not relevant and a zero will be stored. For weight encoded products, the weight is specified in grams and the price entered should be the price per kilogram.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The encoded products can be examined in the 'Table|Encoded products' screen.</span></p>

There are also competitors who offer a similar service, and no doubt the same service is offered in other countries.

They are identified by being given a tax code of 6 - Excluded. The term Excluded can be re-named, but the ID must remain unchanged.

<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Commonly, a hotkey will be used, as the payments may be variable. We used the letter U for utility, so that to pay £10, one entered u1000.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">When the money has been collected, the payment details are entered into the terminal provided by the service and the transaction completed. It is normally complicated to reverse a payment with the system, so it is important to collect the money before entering the details. For this reason, the amounts involved are shown after the sale is complete in the same space as the date is normally shown. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Bill payments cannot be paid by cheque or debit card unless authorised by an owner or manager. For individual bill payments, the *n and blank entry (increase by one) will not work.</span></p>

<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Customer records are stored for one of two purposes. The first is to allow for credit and the second to keep track of customers when service or returns are a required part of the business. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">New customers can be enrolled with the C</span><span class="rvts12">ustomers</span><span class="rvts9"> menu selection </span><span class="rvts10">and then clicking </span><span class="rvts11">New</span><span class="rvts10">. </span><span class="rvts9">Customer numbers by default start at 1000380001, upwards. </span><span class="rvts10">The customer number is filled in automatically. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The details of existing customers can be viewed by selecting and then clicking the </span><span class="rvts11">Details </span><span class="rvts10">button</span><span class="rvts11">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">This will be used later to allow account cards to be scanned into the sales screen. The fields can be stepped through using the Tab key. Names, street names etc. are capitalised on exit. There is provision for two telephone numbers, and </span><span class="rvts10">provision for a second card holder with a different name</span><span class="rvts9">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The print bar code button allows a membership card to be printed. The print is onto the default printer, using a small note size piece of paper. After being signed, this can be folded in half, trimmed with scissors, and then sealed with a credit card size laminating machine. The use of heat sealing to laminate the card stops a thermal receipt printer being used, so the cards are printed on the default printer.</span></p>

<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Select the menu item </span><span class="rvts12">Customers</span><span class="rvts9"> and then choose between by name, or by &nbsp;number. Customers will be listed in the specified order in tabular form. Use the scroll bar to move beyond the visible list. Select any line and then click the </span><span class="rvts12">Details</span><span class="rvts9"> button to see customer details. With this selected, the full details of the customer with the option to print a new membership card for an account is shown. </span><span class="rvts12">Details</span><span class="rvts9"> can be altered and then saved by clicking the OK button. One option that can be changed is the stop tick box. Ticking this will stop further goods being taken by customers with unpaid bills. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The same form, sorted by name is shown when the customer select number, </span><span class="rvts21">1000380000</span><span class="rvts9"> is entered at the sales screen, or a 'charge' or 'received on account' is requested without first selecting a customer. A member can be selected by clicking on a name with the mouse and then clicking the OK button; or scanning an account button. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Bear in mind that the Data Protection Act in the UK, and similar regulations elsewhere, may mean that personal data cannot be shared with other customers at the counter without the consent of the person involved.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The same form is used to select a customer: just scroll through and click on a customer and then press the Enter key. You can also scan or type in a Customer code followed by Tab or Enter.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">To charge a sale to a customer, simply scan the customer barcode at some time during the sale, or using </span><span class="rvts12">Customers&gt;Customer by name</span><span class="rvts9">, select the customer and then press the Enter key. Finally </span><span class="rvts12">Charge</span><span class="rvts9"> the customer account by scanning the </span><span class="rvts12">Charge</span><span class="rvts9"> barcode or typing 1000034 followed by Tab or Enter.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">To refund a customer for returned goods, scan as normal and then press the - (minus) key followed by the Tab or Enter key. The goods will be returned to stock. &nbsp;To return all the items 'sold' so far, press the minus key and then holding down the shift key, press Enter. Finally charge this to the previously selected customer by scanning the </span><span class="rvts12">Charge</span><span class="rvts9"> barcode.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If at any time the </span><span class="rvts12">Charge</span><span class="rvts9"> barcode is scanned without selecting a customer, the </span><span class="rvts12">Customers by name</span><span class="rvts9"> screen appears and you can select a customer at that stage with a mouse followed by the Enter key. With the </span><span class="rvts12">Customers by name</span><span class="rvts9"> screen visible, it is still possible to scan a customer barcode for selection.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">To make a payment off an account, with a customer selected, scan the 'Received' barcode or type 1000035 followed by Tab or Enter. The account balance will be shown as a total, and any amount paid in may be typed in. If this is just an enquiry, enter a zero followed by enter. It is possible to pay money into an account, when no money is owed. Simply press the shift key when pressing the Enter key. To return money paid in this way without purchasing goods, do an enquiry as above, but then type zero, and then hold the shift key down as you press enter.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The screen can also be manipulated entirely by keyboard characters: use the up and down arrows to move the selection up and down, or the page up and page down to jump through the customer names.

<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Subsequently, accounts must be paid for if you are to remain in business. On an empty sales screen, scan the</span><span class="rvts12"> Received on account</span><span class="rvts9"> barcode, or type </span><span class="rvts10">1000035, or use the menu option </span><span class="rvts11">Payment&gt;Received on account</span><span class="rvts10">. The </span><span class="rvts11">Customers by name</span><span class="rvts10"> &nbsp;screen will be displayed to select the correct customer. Alternatively, in this screen, a customer account card carrying a customer number as a barcode can be scanned, to obviate the need to manually select a customer. Then the outstanding balance will be shown and any amount may be tendered in cash, card or cheque, to reduce this. Any remaining balance will be carried forward. If zero is entered as a tender, the sales screen is cleared, allowing for a quick account balance check.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The barcodes for charged and received on account can be printed out using the &nbsp;option </span><a class="rvts16" href="#Printbarcodes">File&gt;Print barcodes</a><span class="rvts10">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Two keyboard shortcuts are provided for these functions: &lt; (cash in, received on account) for </span><span class="rvts11">Received on account</span><span class="rvts10"> and &gt; (goods out, charged) for </span><span class="rvts11">Charged</span><span class="rvts10">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">In some situations you do not wish to extend credit to a customer but want some provision for the customer to pay in advance, and to allow purchases to be deducted from this amount. This can be done by the menu option </span><span class="rvts11">Payment&gt;Credit customer</span><span class="rvts10">, by scanning the </span><span class="rvts11">Credit customer </span><span class="rvts10">barcode or typing 1000043 and then pressing Enter. The customer needs a credit limit of zero, if credit is not to be extended, once the money is spent. When the customer has a positive balance, the figure for balance will appear as a negative amount.</span></p>

<a name="Typesofoffers"></a><h2>Types of offers</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Offers are desirable as a part of the overall offering of any shop. ProffittCenter has a range of offers that can be programmed by an owner or manager. Offers available are currently divided into two groups. These are</span><a class="rvts22" href="#Packoffers"> </a><a class="rvts16" href="#Packoffers">pack offers</a><span class="rvts10">, &nbsp;and</span><a class="rvts22" href="#Quantitydiscounts"> </a><a class="rvts16" href="#Quantitydiscounts">quantity discounts</a><span class="rvts10">. Further offer types may be added in future versions, creating the prospect of an extremely versatile system. The names of the types of offer are not very indicative, and a careful study of the implementation is necessary, if the offers facility is to be fully utilised.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">There is an interaction between offers, and items sold using the @ function (</span><a class="rvts16" href="#Priceover">price over</a><span class="rvts10">) or a </span><a class="rvts16" href="#Discounts">discount</a><span class="rvts10"> given using the % function. In general, if the reduced price is less than the normal price or the offer price, it will be maintained. If this is not true, the two different price reductions are not combined.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Where &nbsp;</span><span class="rvts11">customer discounts </span><span class="rvts10">are in force, these are combined.</span></p>

<a name="Packoffers"></a><h2>Pack offers</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Pack offers are offers that apply to one or more products, where a discount is offered whenever a specified number of items are sold. This is best clarified by a few examples. Suppose we wish to sell four packs of Stella at a discount of 20p from the cost of four individual cans. This equates to 5p a can. However, if five cans are purchased, there is no discount given on the fifth can. If a discount were to be required on the fifth can, then a quantity discount is the required offer type. Another example would be the offer of buying any four bars from a range of six chocolate bars for a pound. This can be applied by giving an offer price of 25p to each of the six products. A range of products can be selected for the offer. Consider a cat food - there might be a range of six flavours all covered by the same offer.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">To set up a pack offer, choose the menu selection Offers|Create and then choose Pack offer in the drop down box.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The required first product is scanned, or the alpha lookup function used. Pressing tab moves the focus to the quantity for the offer and then the limit. Leave the limit as zero if there is no limit. Limit values do not stop the sale of more items - they limit the number of items that can be bought at a discount. Additional items are sold at the full price. The normal price will be filled in when enter is pressed.. The offer price will be the price for the pack. In the example of the bars of chocolate above, this would be £1. Next, the start and end dates are selected by means of a drop down calendars. Offers only have effect between these dates. If more than one product is required for the offer, click the Add button (or type + in the product box) and then enter the additional product. It is not then be necessary to set a price for the offer. The offer will be automatically inactivated on the day after the end date. </span></p>

<a name="Quantitydiscounts"></a><h2>Quantity discounts</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Quantity discounts are offers that apply to one or more products, where a discount is offered whenever a specified number of items are exceeded. The discount is specified as a percentage. This is best clarified by a few examples. Suppose we wish to sell four packs of Stella at a discount price of 80p when the normal price is £1. This equates to 20% reduction. If five cans are purchased, there will also be a discount on all five cans, unlike the pack offer. A range of products can be selected for the offer. Consider a dog food - there might be a range of five flavours, all covered by the same offer of 10p off when you buy three or more.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">To set up a quantity discount, choose the menu selection Offers|Create and then choose Quantity discount in the drop down box.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The required first product is scanned, or the alpha lookup function used. Pressing enter moves the focus to the quantity for the offer and then the limit. Leave the limit as zero if there is no limit. Limit values do not stop the sale of more items - they limit the items that can be bought at a discount. The discount can then be filled in. Next, the start and end dates are selected by means of drop down calendars. If more than one product is required for the offer, click the plus button, and the system will fill in details for subsequent products. The offer will be automatically deactivated on the day after the end date, at program start up. Offers no longer in effect should be deleted using the Offers|View screen, as they can still slow the system down. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">For quantity discounts, it is possible to set the pack size to one. This is useful if you would like to put a special price onto an item as an offer, for a limited period.</span></p>

<a name="Theorderingprocess"></a><h2>The ordering process</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Ordering with ProffittCenter introduces a number of unique ideas to generate orders with an uncanny intelligence. After using the system for some time, one really begins to believe that the system knows best. Before that time, there is ample opportunity to modify and adapt generated orders, so you never loose control.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The first innovation is the estimation of the stock level required. It is best to think of this with the aid of a concrete example. I will base one on my own experience; collecting goods from Booker Cash &amp; Carry, three times a week. On Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings, and also, occasionally, on Saturday morning. Sunday was our busiest day of the week. Clearly, a fixed level for re-ordering a product might have worked, but it would be sub-optimal. The best answer has to be to look at the past sales record to determine future requirements.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The way this is done is explained here. Consider going to Bookers on a Wednesday. The program knows the stock level when generating the order, and the day when fresh stock will be fetched (Friday), after this order is collected. It needs to calculate the number that might be sold between Wednesday morning and Friday morning, and to order a fresh case if this exceeds the number in stock. The best estimate of this number to be sold is obtained by looking at how many were sold in the same time period during the previous week. As this might have been exceptional, the number sold in the same time period two and three weeks before is also calculated, and the worst case (the maximum) selected. This alone would not have any predictive qualities, so in addition to this, three weeks from the previous year are selected, centred on the current time period, but sticking to the same days of the week. As a result of this, items that are seasonal will magically be re-ordered in time.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The second innovation is the integration or stock-checking with the ordering process. It was found in practice that a major reason for errors in orders was errors in stock levels. The worst of these is when a case has not been entered into the system on the previous delivery. In this situation, a second case would be collected, which is not only needlessly expensive, but creates shelf-life problems. To avoid this, each time an order is created, the stock levels of all ordered items should be counted. These levels can be corrected on the order form, and if necessary, the item can be deleted, or a fresh order generated with the corrected values. This has an added benefit in that the levels of stock for items that are ordered are generally low so that counting can be done quickly, and accurately. Once the levels are checked, the stock levels are time stamped, and so will not be included in the next regular stock take, so no additional time is taken.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The third innovation is the calculation of , or return on capital invested (roci). No other EPOS system that we know of will provide this vital figure. Yield is the effective return on investment obtained by investing in a particular line of stock. If you are ever in the position of being limited with the amount of cash that you can invest in stock, then common sense dictates that it should be invested in stock with the highest . This can be easily done with ProffittCenter. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The fourth innovation is the calculation of a sell by date. This allows for the rejection of any stock at a cash and carry that will not be sold completely by it's expire date (sell by or use by date in UK).</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">This has all been explained with just one example. The process is just as applicable to daily milk deliveries, or monthly biscuit orders. Set up the supplier defaults correctly, and all situations are dealt with correctly. Understanding the ordering system is more complicated than with other systems, but is no more complicated to use once defaults have been correctly set up. So persevere and you business will benefit greatly.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The MinStockLevel in the stock record is also now included in the calculations. Do not use this as the default for ordering: a value of 1 is sufficient for general use.</span></p>

<a name="Yield"></a><h2>Yield</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The yield, or return on capital invested, is the effective interest earned by investing money in stock, given the normal rate of sale. The rate of sale is calculated using the past five weeks, plus a five-week period the year before. Profit is calculated using the last known purchase price and the current selling price. Credit provided is effectively free capital and in cases where the product is likely to sell before being paid for, an arbitrary high value is quoted (10000), as calculation is not possible.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Yield can be used to decide whether to buy a product whenever the amount of capital available is limited. The cost of wastes is not used in the calculation.</span></p>

<a name="Generatinganorder"></a><h2>Generating an order</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">After using the mouse to select … After selecting a supplier, the Order create form will appear. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If the supplier defaults have been set up correctly, the next four entries will be set correctly and the Enter key can be pressed to start the order generation process. If not, then see the &nbsp;page. Pressing the OK button will generate an order.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Pressing the Cancel button or the Escape key will return immediately to the sales screen without generating an order.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The generated order may then be examined by selecting &nbsp;on the menu bar.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">As orders are generated based on past sales, it is not possible to correctly generate an order until there is a past sales history. There should be a minimum of three weeks sales records plus the delivery interval; daily orders such as milk will give correct results after three weeks but orders which are placed monthly will require seven weeks of sales history.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The generation of orders can be a lengthy process so do not run it from an active station.</span></p>

<a name="Orderparameters"></a><h2>Order parameters</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Days spare: this is the leeway in stock held. If trade never varied, this could be set to zero to guarantee that enough stock was held to meet all requirements. Even if customers were that reliable, it would mean that trade could never increase. Some experiment may be necessary but the default value of one day is a starting point. Keeping to this value for perishable stock will minimise waste; a higher value for stock with a long life and infrequent delivery will reduce out of stocks. It may be beneficial in some circumstances to increase this. We found that with boxed cakes being delivered on a fortnightly cycle, that on the second week the selection was very &nbsp;poor. While this might be optimal as far as stock is concerned, customers purchasing cake expect a reasonable selection. We found we could increase the days spare stock to seven without seriously affecting waste. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Delivery date: This is the date of the next delivery. Next delivery date: this is the date of the next delivery date after the delivery date. For instance, if going to Cash &amp; Carry on a Wednesday morning, and intending to go again on Friday, enter the date for Friday.

<a name="Vieworders"></a><h2>View orders</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The Order screen is used to make changes to orders once they have been generated. It is opened from the menu command . After selecting a supplier, it shows the last order generated for that supplier. The lines in the order are initially in department order, but can be re-sequenced by pressing the yield order or department buttons.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Yield order is useful if it is necessary to delete items because of cash constraints. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Department order is useful for stock level checking and forms a useful picking order for cash and carry. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The order can be printed out onto A4 paper using the Print button; if a receipt printer is available, then a condensed form of the order can be printed on the receipt printer by pressing the 'Print' key. If any errors are found in the stock levels, double click on the line in error in the Shelf column. The value will be highlighted (go blue with normal colour schemes) and then the corrected value can be typed in the space, followed by the Enter key.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">By selecting the No:' column, the number of cases ordered can be modified by over-typing.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Clicking on any other column in a row will highlight the whole row. This row can then be deleted by pressing delete on the keyboard. A similar effect is achieved by right clicking the mouse and selecting Delete, by left clicking with the mouse. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The Total cost box shows the cost of the order including any sales tax.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The only remaining control is Quit which is self-explanatory. The order is not lost when it is pressed. The Escape key has the same effect. If all of the lines in an order are deleted, the order header is deleted when pressing Quit or moving to a different order. </span></p>

<a name="Deliveryentry"></a><h2>Delivery entry</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The </span><span class="rvts12">Delivery entry</span><span class="rvts9"> screen is accessible either by the menu option &nbsp;or by pressing the function key F11.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The </span><span class="rvts12">Select supplier</span><span class="rvts9"> dialog is shown first. Select the supplier and then press the Enter key to accept.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The </span><span class="rvts12">Select delivery</span><span class="rvts9"> dialog then appears. This show a list of deliveries, identified by their delivery note numbers. Click on one of these and then press Enter or click the OK button. Alternatively, if this is a new delivery, type in the delivery note number (or code) and then click OK; you will then be asked to enter the (delivery note) date.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The </span><span class="rvts12">Delivery entry</span><span class="rvts9"> screen then appears.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Then type or scan, the pack code. If the pack is recognised, the remaining boxes are filled in, and entry moves to the Number of packs box with a default value of one. If more than one pack is delivered, type in the number followed by the Enter key. If it is not recognised, the system will issue an error beep. Enter the code a second time to bring up the &nbsp;screen. Entering the code twice avoids the creation of bogus codes when only a partial scan is completed. The pack codes entered may be the bar code on the pack, the supplier stock code, or an arbitrary code for your convenience. Both letters and numbers are acceptable.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">For instance, for milk, we use the set of codes pas, 2pas, 4pas for one, two and four pint pasteurised milk. For newspapers, we found it convenient to use the single newspaper bar code as a pack code for a paper. This has the advantage that one is not caught out by new Bar codes at the point of sale. For frozen foods, we use the supplier stock codes shown on the invoice. This allows frozen food to be placed immediately into the freezer, prior to data entry. If an unrecognised code is encountered, it is necessary to retrieve a sample from the freezer to obtain the product bar code. For most other products, we use the pack bar code. It may not be possible to read this with a CCD scanner.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">For most items obtained singly, other than milk, we have a policy of always buying in two at a time, as this will allow for sales to increase more easily with demand. We then entered a 2 before scanning the single item bar code. This scheme is extendible to higher numbers. The advantage of this, over just using the bar code, is that a common mistake is to scan a bar code after serving a customer without first pressing F11. Without the need for a preceding digit, the item will be recognised as a sale.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">On pressing the Tab key, the focus moves to the Pack price box. Check this value to see if it has changed since the last delivery, and if it has, then type in the new wholesale price in pence, excluding VAT, followed by the Enter key. (Exclude VAT even if you are unregistered.)</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Entry then moves to the Product price box. If this has changed, type in the new price in pence, followed by the Enter key. If a new price label is needed, press the function key, F10. (Note that the price label will be at the old price if the price has changed. Step through to the end to accept the entry and then scan the pack again before pressing F10.)</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If you wish to maintain the margin after a price increase, type in the margin and press the Enter key to give a new price at the specified margin.</span><span class="rvts9"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If the margin is out of range of the default department margin, a warning dialog will appear. The mouse can be used to go back to the Product price box if a change is needed. If not, pressing the Enter key again will enter the data into the database.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The Cancel button will cancel the current inputs but leave the screen active while the Quit button or the Escape key will return to the sales screen.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">It is permissible to have a Number of cases value of zero. This allows the wholesale price to be updated without a delivery.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Pressing the Enter key will operate the OK button. The delivery is then entered into the delivery table and any changes made are updated.</span></p>

It shows a table of stock that has been delivered and then entered via the </span><span class="rvts11">Delivery entry</span><span class="rvts10"> screen. A running total of the cost of items listed is shown, and the operator can enter the equivalent total from an invoice in the </span><span class="rvts11">Invoice total</span><span class="rvts10"> box. The same is true for tax. There is also a </span><span class="rvts11">Completed</span><span class="rvts10"> checkbox to show that the delivery has been fully dealt with. When the default </span><span class="rvts11">OK</span><span class="rvts10"> button is clicked, these values are saved.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">If wholesale prices are entered during delivery entry, these are shown as Invoice total when the screen is opened. There will be times when the true price is not known when the delivery is received, and the prices entered will be the previous price, the price calculated using the default margin, or zero. In the delivery screen, prices can be corrected and ultimately, the two sets of figures should tally. Remember to operate the </span><span class="rvts11">OK</span><span class="rvts10"> (tick) button to save any changes.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Note that completed deliveries will no longer appear as a choice when </span><span class="rvts11">Delivery entry</span><span class="rvts10"> is attempted.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">At the top of the screen are buttons that can change the retail and wholesale (pack) price of the selected delivery line by clicking the appropriate button and then making the change. This allows for the correction of entries in line with the invoice, when the invoice is received at a later date.</span></p>

<a name="Stocktakingprocess"></a><h2>Stocktaking process</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Accurate stocktaking is the most important element of a computerised stock control system. Scanning at the point of sale will eliminate almost all errors in stock purchased by customers but errors can be introduced by a number of other factors.</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li class="rvps9" style="margin-left: 0; text-indent: 0px"><span class="rvts9">Customer theft – the most obvious source of errors</span></li>
<li class="rvps9" style="margin-left: 0; text-indent: 0px"><span class="rvts9">Staff theft – often larger than customer theft</span></li>
<li class="rvps9" style="margin-left: 0; text-indent: 0px"><span class="rvts9">Failure to record stock when delivered</span></li>
<li class="rvps9" style="margin-left: 0; text-indent: 0px"><span class="rvts9">Recording stock deliveries more than once, or miss-keying the number of packs</span></li>
<li class="rvps9" style="margin-left: 0; text-indent: 0px"><span class="rvts9">Errors in pack sizes recorded</span></li>
<li class="rvps9" style="margin-left: 0; text-indent: 0px"><span class="rvts9">Miss-counts or recording errors during a stock-take</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">While theft levels are important information when running a shop, errors due to other effects can often disguise true theft levels. Errors in stock levels will also result in unnecessary out-of-stocks and over-ordering. The more effective the ordering system is at minimising the total stock levels, the more damaging stock level errors will be.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Consider the effect of the theft of say three bars of chocolate. Until the stock level is checked and corrected, the chocolate bars may never be ordered again.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The same problem can arise with routine stock-takes. Say there has just been a delivery of the same chocolate bars, and there are now 50 bars on the shelf. With a number this large it is fairly easy to make a mistake. Three under, and you will end up in the same situation and be convinced that there is a theft problem.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Data entry is also a problem. Extra key presses such as typing 77 instead of 7 can lead to significant errors. Entering a sheet of stock-take figures can lead to whole pages of errors when a single row is missed out.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The stocktaking methods used here have been evolved to reduce all these errors to a minimum.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">First, all stock checks are date stamped. This allows for stocktaking on a rolling basis.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Second, stocktaking can be confined to items with a low stock count – less than ten items. This allows for rapid stocktaking and few errors in counts. This does mean that if this method is used exclusively, slow moving stock with high counts may never be counted, but errors in slow moving stock do not impact on profitability to the same degree.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Third, a stock-take of lines ordered is routinely done. These tend to be mostly low numbers, and this eliminates over-ordering due to errors caused by not entering stock when delivered.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The result of these strategies is that most stock is stock-checked every month without much effort. Fast moving stock will be counted much more often.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The Stocktaking by Department&gt;All screen can be activated by using the Alt-s combination.</span></p>

There are also options for stock taking a single product, a department, all stock of a single supplier, all stock with a zero, or with a negative level. There is also an option to stock take items with a quantity of less than 10. This option is sometimes useful as it avoids counting large numbers, as mentioned in the previous help page.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The Stock take screen shows a table of 26 entries with columns headed </span><span class="rvts12">SKU</span><span class="rvts9"> (Stock Keeping Unit), Product, Quantity and Date.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The SKU and Product columns show the SKU ID and linked product description. Remember that when multiple products are linked by a common stock entry, that only one count is maintained. The product description shown is the one with the last recorded delivery.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The Quantity column shows the recorded stock quantity. Clicking on this column with the left-hand mouse button will open this quantity for editing. Simply over-type the new value and then press the Enter key. Any downward change in stock level will be recorded in the sales table as a positive . </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The Date column, which shows the date of the last stock take, will then change to the current date, and the item will cease to be displayed. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">When all the stock levels have been checked, clicking the All Checked button will change all of the dates to the current date and close the screen.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The Print button (or Alt P) prints the visible table on the default printer whereas the function key F10 will print to a receipt printer if fitted. The screen is closed after printing. Quit or escape close the screen in other cases.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Note that products can only appear in the stock take screen if the date they were last checked is before today's date. New products that have only been created today will not appear unless the quantity was never changed from the default of zero. Also &nbsp;and &nbsp;products are excluded completely.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">For each option, you can select either Default or All; Default will show a screen of 26 items, All will show a screen with all items, using scroll bars if needed. Use default for preference.</span></p>

<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">1 &nbsp;Use Default setting of the stocktake screen</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">2 &nbsp;Press Print key to get a list of stock</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">3 &nbsp;Check each quantity matches or write down correct quantity next to quantity</span></p>

<a name="Thecashingupprocess"></a><h2>The cashing up process</h2>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">At the end of each operator's shift, the money in the cash drawer needs to be checked. The standard process for this is for the operator to use the menu option 'Reports|Cash up'. A short printout is issued from the receipt printer and the cash drawer will open. This should be placed together with the cash for subsequent reconciliation. This can either be in a separable cash tray, or in a bag or other suitable device.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Subsequently, the person responsible for cash should reconcile the cash amounts. They select the menu option 'Reports|Reconcile cashups' and select the cashup ID on the printout with the money from the list displayed. Then, after clicking the OK button, the money can be counted and the counts entered into the left hand column of boxes, as appropriate using the Tab key to step from box to box. The values can be typed in. When all of these amounts have been entered, click the 'Calculate' button.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The error in the cash amount is shown together with lists of 'Debits', 'Cheques', 'Coupons', 'Received on account' and 'Paid outs', and their totals. Check these all against the paperwork that should be with the cash. Any errors should be entered into the totals boxes for record. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Finally click the 'Save' button. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">For the 'Float' - the cash put into the cash drawer at the start of a shift, there are two options. The first is to set the 'Float value' on the settings screen to some value in pence; so for a £25 float, set the value to 2,500. It is then expected that the float will be £25 every time the cashing up process is started. The second option is for the 'Float value' to be set to zero. When this is the case, at the start of a shift, the operator will be asked to enter the float value, in pence. Once this has been done, operators will not be asked again until 'Reports|Cash up' is activated. This is true even if the operators change during the day.</span></p>

<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">On selecting 'Reports|Cashing up', a display of key figures is shown since the last cashing up.

In addition, the sum of </span><span class="rvts12">Accounts charged</span><span class="rvts9"> is shown. These figures will include any tax taken. In addition, the start and end date and time for the cashing up period (Starting from the last time and ending now), and the operator who performed the cashing up. On clicking OK, the program closes down. To reconcile the takings, the cash, debits,coupons and Paid outs in the till should equal to the Takings figure less the Charges plus any Agency sales. &nbsp;The figure for the takings for accounting purposes is taken from '' for the given period. The takings are counted and reconciled using the &nbsp;screen.</span></p>

<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The next drop down box allows a choice between four options; Excluded from stock take, Included in stock take (the default), Other peoples stock, and Videos. Most stock is of course included in any stock take. The option Other peoples stock, allows for a separate value to be calculated for stock that is put into the shop but not paid for until sold. Videos for rent have to be treated separately, as a rental does not decrease the stock level. Certain other items have to be excluded from any stock take.

Yield is a calculation of return on money invested, and clearly, the only money invested that is of concern to retailers is their own money.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The box labelled Days to next delivery is the number of days between successive deliveries. If a supplier delivers just once a week, the entry will be 7. If deliveries are more than once a week, leave this entry blank.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The box labelled Days spare stock is set to indicate just how much stock will be sitting on the shelf just prior to the next delivery. A figure of one is a practical minimum, because of the variation in buying patterns of customers. Higher values can be of use when suppliers make infrequent deliveries. A low figure can only be tolerated with accurate stock level figures. Lack of diligence in stocktaking can result in products never being ordered.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The final entries are a row of check boxes labelled to represent the days of the week on which deliveries are made. For milk deliveries on six days a week, Monday to Saturday, simply click on all but the first button.</span></p>

N</span><span class="rvts26">umber of packs</span><span class="rvts8"> can be set to zero to avoid entering additional stock. However, if you make a mistake on entry, this will not correct this mistake. Say that you have packs of 24 Coca Cola, but you mistakenly leave the </span><span class="rvts26">Pack size</span><span class="rvts8"> at 1, then in addition to having the wrong pack size, you will have the wrong number in stock. What you would need to do is to deliver another 23 single cans and then change the </span><span class="rvts26">Pack size</span><span class="rvts8"> to 24 and deliver 0 of these. This would leave all prices, margins and stock levels correct.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts8">As an alternative problem, if you had mistakenly changed the </span><span class="rvts26">Pack size</span><span class="rvts8"> from 1 to 9, you would have delivered 8 to many, so in </span><span class="rvts26">Delivery entry</span><span class="rvts8"> change the </span><span class="rvts26">Pack size</span><span class="rvts8"> to 1 and deliver -8.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts8">Wholesale and retail prices can be corrected in the Delivery screen. Say we had accepted a delivery of Coca Cola cans but entered a price of 69p instead of £6.95.

<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts8">The </span><span class="rvts26">Pack </span><span class="rvts8">record can also be altered by going to</span><span class="rvts26"> </span><a class="rvts27" href="#Packs">Tables&gt;Packs</a><span class="rvts26">,</span><span class="rvts8"> searching for Coca Cola using the </span><span class="rvts26">Product </span><span class="rvts8">search box, clicking on the </span><span class="rvts26">Information</span><span class="rvts8"> button and then making changes. </span></p>
