    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">In some situations, it is
        necessary to track the customer name for certain purchased
        items. An example of this would be the sale of mobile phones,
        each individually identified by a serial number. If one is later
        brought back for repair, the customer name can be entered, and
        the details of the sale recovered, allowing the serial number to
        be checked, and the date of purchase.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Products to be tracked are
        distinguished by there being a letter <strong>T</strong> in
        their </span><a class="rvts16" href="Department.html">Department

        restriction</a><span class="rvts10">.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">When a tracked product is
        sold, there is a tada and the customer screen is displayed. If
        the customer is already on record, the appropriate record is
        clicked prior to clicking on the OK button, or simply double
        clicked. If the customer is not on record, clicking the OK
        button, or pressing the enter key, will bring up the new
        customer screen, so that details can be entered.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Once this is done, a screen is
        displayed for entry of the item code, and then the OK button
        clicked to complete the sale. When the sale is completed,
        information is stored in the sales table for later use.</span></p>
