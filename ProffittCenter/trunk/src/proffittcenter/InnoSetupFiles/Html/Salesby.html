    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Clicking on this option
        reveals four further options: sales by department, operator,
        quantity and value. Clicking on any of these leads to the same
        screen. An addition set of reports include wastes, losses,
        returns, charges, received on account and own use. Operation of
        each is fairly self-explanatory - just set a start date and an
        end date and then click OK. A report of all sales in the
        selected period is produced after a delay. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The reports on discounts or
        priced over will only show the sales in which one or more
        products have been discounted or priced over, as this is the
        only information saved. If it is desired to know which item was
        affected, it will be necessary to examine the sales record and
        determine which prices have been altered from normal.</span></p>
    <span class="rvts10">A print button is provided that will print out
      an image of the screen on the default printer. There is also a
      copy button that will appear after the ok button has been clicked.
      This will copy the whole</span><span class="rvts10"><a href="Cashingup.html"></a>
      screen to the clipboard of the computer, for use in other
      programs.</span> <span class="rvts8"></span>
