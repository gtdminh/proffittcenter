    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The yield, or return on capital
        invested, is the effective interest earned by investing money in
        stock, given the normal rate of sale. The rate of sale is
        calculated using the past five weeks, plus a five-week period
        the year before. Profit is calculated using the last known
        purchase price and the current selling price. Credit provided is
        effectively free capital and in cases where the product is
        likely to sell before being paid for, an arbitrary high value is
        quoted (10000), as calculation is not possible.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Yield can be used to decide
        whether to buy a product whenever the amount of capital
        available is limited. The cost of wastes is not used in the
        calculation.</span></p>
