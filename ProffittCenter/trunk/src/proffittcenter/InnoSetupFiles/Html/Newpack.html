    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Fill in the details of the
        pack. A Product ID, such as a bar code, can be scanned or typed
        in or a search of the Products database by typing in the first
        few letters selecting a product with the mouse. If the product
        is not recognised then the <a href="Newproduct.html"><strong>New
            product</strong></a> screen will appear.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The Pack code on the first
        screen is the code entered in the <a href="Deliveryentry.html"><strong>Delivery
            entry</strong></a> screen except in the case of short codes
        where there is a strong chance that two manufacturers will use
        the same code. In this case, the code will be preceded by the
        Supplier ID followed by a <strong>+</strong> symbol. This
        creates a unique extended code for the pack; however, there is
        never any need to enter this extended code â€“ just stick to the
        short code on entry, and the extra characters will be added by
        the system. Pack codes are not necessarily restricted to
        numbers, to allow supplier stock codes to be used. These can
        normally be read from the invoice.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">When the <strong>OK </strong>button
        is clicked, or the <strong>Enter </strong>key pressed, a fresh
        form is shown.</span></p>
