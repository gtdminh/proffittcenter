    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Quantity discounts are offers
        that apply to one or more products, where a discount is offered
        whenever a specified number of items are exceeded. The discount
        is specified as a percentage. This is best clarified by a few
        examples. Suppose we wish to sell four packs of Stella at a
        discount price of 80p when the normal price is Â£1. This equates
        to 20% reduction. If five cans are purchased, there will also be
        a discount on all five cans, unlike the pack offer. A range of
        products can be selected for the offer. Consider a dog food -
        there might be a range of five flavours, all covered by the same
        offer of 10p off when you buy three or more.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">To set up a quantity discount,
        choose the menu selection Offers|Create and then choose Quantity
        discount in the drop down box.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The required first product is
        scanned, or the alpha lookup function used. Pressing enter moves
        the focus to the quantity for the offer and then the limit.
        Leave the limit as zero if there is no limit. Limit values do
        not stop the sale of more items - they limit the items that can
        be bought at a discount. The discount can then be filled in.
        Next, the start and end dates are selected by means of drop down
        calendars. If more than one product is required for the offer,
        click the plus button, and the system will fill in details for
        subsequent products. The offer will be automatically deactivated
        on the day after the end date, at program start up. Offers no
        longer in effect should be deleted using the Offers|View screen,
        as they can still slow the system down. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">For quantity discounts, it is
        possible to set the pack size to one. This is useful if you
        would like to put a special price onto an item as an offer, for
        a limited period.</span></p>
