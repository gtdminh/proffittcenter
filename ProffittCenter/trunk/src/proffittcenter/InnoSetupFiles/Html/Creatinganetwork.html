    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Before networking
        ProffittCenter, you need to set up a network. With Microsoft XP,
        this is not difficult, and will not be described here. However,
        the network should be stable, and you should be able to 'see'
        any computer from any other computer on the network. If access
        seems to be blocked, do not forget to check whether any
        installed firewalls are causing problems. Once you have created
        a satisfactory network, there are a number of steps that you
        need to take to set up a fully functioning ProffittCenter
        network, and these are detailed in the <a href="Settingupanetwork.html">Setting



          up a Network</a>.</span></p>
