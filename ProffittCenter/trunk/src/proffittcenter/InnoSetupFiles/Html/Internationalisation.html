    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Some effort has been made to
        internationalise ProffittCenter. The currency symbols are set in
        the Settings screen. Note that there is a symbol or symbols for
        the main currency such as £ in the UK and also one for the penny
        (in the UK). (That is, in the USA $ and c.) Unfortunately,
        ProffittCenter will not work for very low value currencies as
        the maximum cash tender is £15000 ($15000 etc.).</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The text in all of the screens
        and in messages can be changed. Contact ProffittCenter if you
        wish to help with this.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Finally, there is the use of
        English in help files. This is unlikely to change without
        international help in re-writing them. This would be a much
        bigger job.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">We hope that this does not put
        you off from trying out the program. We currently have
        registered users in Ireland, Netherlands, USA, Philippines,
        India, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Norway and many more. We would
        love to increase this list.</span></p>
