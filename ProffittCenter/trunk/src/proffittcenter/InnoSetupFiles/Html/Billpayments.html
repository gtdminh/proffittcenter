    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">In the UK there is a service
        called PayPoint that many shops participate in, that allows
        money to be collected for various bill payment facilities. There
        are also competitors who offer a similar service, and no doubt
        the same service is offered in other countries. The money
        collected is not a part of the shop's turnover; the shop is
        collecting it on behalf of service as an agent and for this
        reason, the payments are referred to in ProffittCenter as Agency
        payments. They are identified by being given a tax code of 6 -
        Excluded. The term Excluded can be re-named, but the ID must
        remain unchanged. Any product with an Excluded tax rate will not
        be included in the shop's takings and a separate tally will be
        maintained in the </span><a class="rvts16" href="Takings.html">Takings</a><span

        class="rvts10"> screen.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Commonly, a hotkey will be
        used, as the payments may be variable. We used the letter U for
        utility, so that to pay Â£10, one entered u1000.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">When the money has been
        collected, the payment details are entered into the terminal
        provided by the service and the transaction completed. It is
        normally complicated to reverse a payment with the system, so it
        is important to collect the money before entering the details.
        For this reason, the amounts involved are shown after the sale
        is complete in the same space as the date is normally shown. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Bill payments cannot be paid
        by cheque or debit card unless authorised by an owner or
        manager. For individual bill payments, the *n and blank entry
        (increase by one) will not work.</span></p>
