    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The Order screen is used to
        make changes to orders once they have been generated. It is
        opened from the menu command . After selecting a supplier, it
        shows the last order generated for that supplier. The lines in
        the order are initially in department order, but can be
        re-sequenced by pressing the yield order or department buttons.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Yield order is useful if it is
        necessary to delete items because of cash constraints. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Department order is useful for
        stock level checking and forms a useful picking order for cash
        and carry. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The order can be printed out
        onto A4 paper using the Print button; if a receipt printer is
        available, then a condensed form of the order can be printed on
        the receipt printer by pressing the 'Print' key. If any errors
        are found in the stock levels, double click on the line in error
        in the Shelf column. The value will be highlighted (go blue with
        normal colour schemes) and then the corrected value can be typed
        in the space, followed by the Enter key.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">By selecting the No:' column,
        the number of cases ordered can be modified by over-typing.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Clicking on any other column in
        a row will highlight the whole row. This row can then be deleted
        by pressing delete on the keyboard. A similar effect is achieved
        by right clicking the mouse and selecting Delete, by left
        clicking with the mouse. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The Total cost box shows the
        cost of the order including any sales tax.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The only remaining control is
        Quit which is self-explanatory. The order is not lost when it is
        pressed. The Escape key has the same effect. If all of the lines
        in an order are deleted, the order header is deleted when
        pressing Quit or moving to a different order. </span></p>
