    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">ProffittCenter is released
        under the GPL or Open Source licence. This means that you are
        free to copy the program and distribute it as long as you
        include the source code, or make this available to a third
        party. The same applies if you modify the program. You may not
        release the program or a modified program under a more
        restrictive licence.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The help files are copyright,
        but the original distribution includes this. This means that you
        are free to use and distribute the help files, but may not
        derive other works from them, such as printed manuals, without
        permission of the author.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The full terms of the GPL
        licence are given below. You will be asked to agree to its terms
        when you install the program.</span></p>

    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The Open Source Definition,
        Version 1.0</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Open source doesn't just mean
        access to the source code. The distribution terms of an
        open-source program must comply with the following criteria:</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Free Redistribution </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The license may not restrict
        any party from selling or giving away the software as a
        component of an aggregate software distribution containing
        programs from several different sources. The license may not
        require a royalty or other fee for such sale. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Source Code </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The program must include source
        code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as
        compiled form. Where some form of a product is not distributed
        with source code, there must be a well-publicized means of
        downloading the source code, without charge, via the Internet.
        The source code must be the preferred form in which a programmer
        would modify the program. Deliberately obfuscated source code is
        not allowed. Intermediate forms such as the output of a
        preprocessor or translator are not allowed. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Derived Works </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The license must allow
        modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be
        distributed under the same terms as the license of the original
        software. (rationale)</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Integrity of the Author's
        Source Code </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The license may restrict source
        code from being distributed in modified form only if the license
        allows the distribution of "patch files" with the source code
        for the purpose of modifying the program at build time. The
        license must explicitly permit distribution of software built
        from modified source code. The license may require derived works
        to carry a different name or version number from the original
        software. (rationale)</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">No Discrimination Against
        Persons or Groups </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The license must not
        discriminate against any person or group of persons. (rationale)</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">No Discrimination Against
        Fields of Endeavor </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The license must not restrict
        anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of
        endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program from
        being used in a business, or from being used for genetic
        research. (rationale)</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Distribution of License </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The rights attached to the
        program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed
        without the need for execution of an additional license by those
        parties. (rationale)</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">License Must Not Be Specific to
        a Product </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The rights attached to the
        program must not depend on the program's being part of a
        particular software distribution. If the program is extracted
        from that distribution and used or distributed within the terms
        of the program's license, all parties to whom the program is
        redistributed should have the same rights as those that are
        granted in conjunction with the original software distribution.
        (rationale)</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">License Must Not Contaminate
        Other Software </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The license must not place
        restrictions on other software that is distributed along with
        the licensed software. For example, the license must not insist
        that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be
        open-source software. (rationale)</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Example Licenses </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The GNU GPL, BSD, X Consortium,
        and Artistic licenses are examples of licenses that we consider
        conformant to the Open Source Definition. So is the MPL.</span></p>

    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free
        Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place--Suite 330, Boston, MA
        02111-1307, USA</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Everyone is permitted to copy
        and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but
        changing it is not allowed.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Preamble</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The licenses for most software
        are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.
        By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
        guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
        make sure the software is free for all its users. This General
        Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's
        software and to any other program whose authors commit to using
        it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
        the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply
        it to your programs, too.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">When we speak of free software,
        we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public
        Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
        distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service
        if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
        want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
        new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">To protect your rights, we need
        to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights
        or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
        translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
        copies of the software, or if you modify it.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">For example, if you distribute
        copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must
        give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
        sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you
        must show them these terms so they know their rights.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">We protect your rights with two
        steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this
        license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
        and/or modify the software.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Also, for each author's
        protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone
        understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If
        the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want
        its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,
        so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
        the original authors' reputations.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Finally, any free program is
        threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the
        danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
        obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
        proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
        patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed
        at all.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The precise terms and
        conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR
        COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">This License applies to any
        program or other work which contains a notice placed by the
        copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
        this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any
        such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
        either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
        that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of
        it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into
        another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without
        limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is
        addressed as "you". </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Activities other than copying,
        distribution and modification are not covered by this License;
        they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is
        not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only
        if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
        (independent of having been made by running the Program).
        Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">You may copy and distribute
        verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it,
        in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
        publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
        disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer
        to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
        other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along
        with the Program. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">You may charge a fee for the
        physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option
        offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">You may modify your copy or
        copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work
        based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
        or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
        also meet all of these conditions: </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">You must cause the modified
        files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the
        files and the date of any change. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">You must cause any work that
        you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or
        is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed
        as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
        this License. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If the modified program
        normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause
        it, when started running for such interactive use in the most
        ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
        appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no
        warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that
        users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and
        telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception:
        if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print
        such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not
        required to print an announcement.) These requirements apply to
        the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that
        work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
        considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
        this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when
        you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute
        the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
        the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
        of this License, whose permissions for other licencees extend to
        the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of
        who wrote it. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Thus, it is not the intent of
        this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work
        written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
        right to control the distribution of derivative or collective
        works based on the Program.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">In addition, mere aggregation
        of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or
        with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
        distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
        scope of this License.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">You may copy and distribute the
        Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code
        or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
        provided that you also do one of the following: </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Accompany it with the complete
        corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be
        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
        medium customarily used for software interchange; or, </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Accompany it with a written
        offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party,
        for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing
        source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
        corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
        Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
        interchange; or, </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Accompany it with the
        information you received as to the offer to distribute
        corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for
        noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program
        in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord
        with Subsection b above.) The source code for a work means the
        preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For
        an executable work, complete source code means all the source
        code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
        definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
        and installation of the executable. However, as a special
        exception, the source code distributed need not include anything
        that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)
        with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
        operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
        component itself accompanies the executable. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If distribution of executable
        or object code is made by offering access to copy from a
        designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
        source code from the same place counts as distribution of the
        source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy
        the source along with the object code.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">You may not copy, modify,
        sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly
        provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
        modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
        automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
        parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
        License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
        parties remain in full compliance. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">You are not required to accept
        this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing
        else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
        or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if
        you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or
        distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you
        indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its
        terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
        Program or works based on it. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Each time you redistribute the
        Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient
        automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
        copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms
        and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on
        the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are
        not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
        this License. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If, as a consequence of a court
        judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other
        reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on
        you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
        contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
        you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
        distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations
        under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as
        a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For
        example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
        redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
        directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could
        satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely
        from distribution of the Program. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If any portion of this section
        is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular
        circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply
        and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
        circumstances.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">It is not the purpose of this
        section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property
        right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
        section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the
        free software distribution system, which is implemented by
        public license practices. Many people have made generous
        contributions to the wide range of software distributed through
        that system in reliance on consistent application of that
        system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
        willing to distribute software through any other system and a
        licensee cannot impose that choice.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">This section is intended to
        make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of
        the rest of this License.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If the distribution and/or use
        of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by
        patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
        holder who places the Program under this License may add an
        explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
        countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
        countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License
        incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
        License. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The Free Software Foundation
        may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public
        License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
        spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
        address new problems or concerns. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Each version is given a
        distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a
        version number of this License which applies to it and "any
        later version", you have the option of following the terms and
        conditions either of that version or of any later version
        published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does
        not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any
        version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If you wish to incorporate
        parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution

    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">How to Apply These Terms to
        Your New Programs</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If you develop a new program,
        and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the
        public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
        which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">To do so, attach the following
        notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start
        of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of
        warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright"
        line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">One line to give the program's
        name and an idea of what it does. Copyright (C) 19yy name of

    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Also add information on how to
        contact you by electronic and paper mail.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If the program is interactive,
        make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an
