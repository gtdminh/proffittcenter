    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">You can arrange the monitor on
        the counter, at right angles, so that both the sales assistant
        and the customer can view the sales screen at the same time.
        This should be to the right of the salesperson, with the
        standard keyboard positioned on the left. This will ensure that
        the numeric keypad, with all the most commonly used keys, is
        easy to reach. The cash drawer can be used as a base on which
        the monitor and receipt printer can be placed. The laser scanner
        stand should be attached to the counter adjacent to the cash
        drawer. The computer, in a tower case, can be placed within the
        counter, below the cash drawer. The cash drawer is similar in
        size to a standard cash register.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">It will be necessary to drill
        some holes for the cables. Typical cable lengths are video:
        1.5m, serial receipt printer: 2m, parallel printer cable: up to
        3m, scanner: 1m. The connection from the receipt printer to the
        cash drawer is short ~ 0.5m. The telephone connection can be
        easily extended to reach the computer with standard telephone
        extension cables. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">A pole display is advised. We
        prefer the pass-trough variety. ESC/POS is the standard
        interface.</span></p>
