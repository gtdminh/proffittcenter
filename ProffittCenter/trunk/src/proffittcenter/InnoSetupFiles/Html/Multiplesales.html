    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Sell a single product as normal

        or </span><span class="rvts18">.n (point n) </span><span class="rvts9">and

        then press the </span><span class="rvts12">Enter</span><span class="rvts9">
        key, where </span><span class="rvts12">n</span><span class="rvts9">
        is the number to be sold. The value of n can be negative for
        refunds (return to stock). </span></p>
    <p class="rvps1"><span class="rvts18">Or</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Type </span><span class="rvts12">n</span><span
        class="rvts9"> and then scan a single product where n is the
        number to be sold and n is in the range 2 to 9. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps1"><span class="rvts18">Or</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Press Enter on its own after a
        product sale to increase the number of products sold by one.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The number of any products
        sold, when incorrect, can be corrected by selecting the line
        first, if it is not the last line, and then typing </span><span
        class="rvts18">*n</span><span class="rvts9"> or </span><span class="rvts18">.n</span><span

    <h2 class="rvps3"><span class="rvts18">Negative sales</span></h2>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">To sell a negative quantity
        (i.e. to accept back stock that has been previously sold) just
        type a minus followed by </span><span class="rvts12">Enter</span><span
        class="rvts9"> after the initial sale. Note that pressing the </span><span
        class="rvts12">Enter</span><span class="rvts9"> key subsequently
        will increase the number by -1; that is, if we have a sale of -1
        items and then press the Enter key again, there will become -2
        items sold. Another way of accomplishing the same effect is to
        type </span><span class="rvts18">-</span><span class="rvts9">
        (minus) before scanning the product bar code. If a product
        returned, is not fit for resale, proceed in the same way, but

        class="rvts9"> or </span><a class="rvts16" href="Returnablewastes.html">Returnable

    <h2 class="rvps3"><span class="rvts18">Finally</span></h2>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The operation of the sales
        screen initially seem complicated by the large number of ways of
        achieving the same result; each operator is free to choose
        whichever method seems easiest at the time. There is provision
        for a training mode by creating an operator with an authority of
        '5'. With this operator using the machine, no sales are recorded
        so that the operator is free to practice using the different
        methods of operation.</span></p>
