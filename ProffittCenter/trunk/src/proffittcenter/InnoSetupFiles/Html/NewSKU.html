    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The Stock quantity box would
        normally be left at zero for new stock if this dialog has been
        generated by a stock entry procedure. If it has been generated
        from the </span><span class="rvts12">Sales screen</span><span class="rvts9">
        or from</span><span class="rvts12"> Starting stock</span><span class="rvts9">
        entry, the value can be filled in.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Stock minimum is normally set
        to zero. A higher value should ensure that the stock level
        should never fall below that value.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The Default case size and
        Default supplier are used to enable ordering of stock that did
        not originally arrive in a case, such as where a rep leaves a
        few bars of a new line of chocolate. Filling these in will
        ensure that they will be re-ordered when the stock is gone.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The Department is
        self-explanatory; after selection, the Vat rate will be set to
        the default for the department. If this is not correct, then
        change it as required. A separate Vat rate has been set up for
        video rental (or services), even though these incur standard
        rate in the UK.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The next drop down box allows a
        choice between four options; Excluded from stock take, Included
        in stock take (the default), Other peoples stock, and Videos.
        Most stock is of course included in any stock take. The option
        Other peoples stock, allows for a separate value to be
        calculated for stock that is put into the shop but not paid for
        until sold. Videos for rent have to be treated separately, as a
        rental does not decrease the stock level. Certain other items
        have to be excluded from any stock take. One example would be
        photocopies.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Move between fields using the
        Tab key and press the Enter key to accept all of the values
        entered. Escape will close the screen without accepting any
        values.</span></p>
