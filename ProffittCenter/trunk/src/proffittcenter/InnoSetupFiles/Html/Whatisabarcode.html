    </div>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">A barcode is simply a way of
        encoding characters in a simple machine readable format of black
        bars, normally printed onto a white background. The characters
        encoded may be just numbers or both letters and numbers. There
        are a variety of different codes used to translate between the
        characters and the black and white bands. These codes are
        generally known as symbologies. Products in a supermarket are
        universally coded with an EAN13 or EAN8 symbology. EAN is for
        the European Article Numbering Association, and the 13 or 8
        refers to the number of digits (numbers only) encoded. In
        America, the equivalent standard is UPC for Universal Product
        Code and is broadly similar. EAN13 codes can also have an
        extension code added. These are commonly used for issue
        identification with magazines.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Bars in the code are
        distinguished by their width; normally a choice is made between
        two widths, one unit or two units wide. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">There are a large number of
        other codes available, but the main additional one of interest
        is Code 39. This is used by this program for any bar codes that
        are printed out. These are printed with a free bar code font
        provided by Bar Codes, Inc. at </span><span class="rvts11">http://www.barcodesinc.com/free-barcode-font/</span><span
        class="rvts10"> . You are free to use these fonts in other
        applications. For instance, you might wish to generate bar code
        labels with a spread sheet program, such as Excel. Any number
        represented in Code 39 needs to have a * character both before
        and after the number as start and stop codes. That is, if you
        want a number 1003456, you need to have the string of characters
        *1003456* printed in the Code 39 font. To see how this works, </span><span
        class="rvts13">*1003456* </span><span class="rvts10">is the
        same string in the Code 39 font. These need to be printed with a
        high quality printer; ideally a high resolution laser printer,
        although success can be achieved with an ink jet printer. A dot
        matrix printer is not suitable.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">It is common practice to print
        the number that is coded below the actual bar code as this makes
        it possible to enter a code manually if the scanner fails to
        read it successfully.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The machine readable part is
        satisfied by an optical system together with a unit that
        converts light signals into an electrical signal. There are two
        main ways of doing this. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The bar code can be
        illuminated, and then an image of the bar code is converted by a
        device that is similar in principle to a video camera, except
        that it only scans a single line, instead of a rectangular area.
        These sensors are based on CCD (charge coupled device)
        technology and hence the scanners based on them are known as CCD
        scanners. The illumination is provided by a set or LEDs (light
        emitting diodes) and such scanners are often recognised by the
        pulsing red light that they give off. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The other approach used is to
        scan the barcode with an intense, collimated moving beam of
        light, and to detect the reflected light with a simple
        photo-detector. The intense beam of light is provided by a solid
        state visible laser, normally red. These devices are robust and
        have a long life. The power in the light beam is insufficient to
        cause eye damage, although looking into the beam is not without
        risk. The effective intensity is high because the laser light is
        monochromatic, allowing much of the ambient light to be removed
        by a simple filter before detection. The beam is scanned with a
        mechanical system of rotating or nutating mirrors, either along
        a straight line, or in a complex two dimensional pattern for an
        omni-directional scanner. The use of a mechanical system makes
        such scanners less rugged overall, but they have the advantage
        of high readability and fast acquisition. They can read bar
        codes at a distance, including the larger case codes, and are
        far less dependent upon the actual distance that the bar code is
        from the scanner, as image focusing is not involved. Most types
        will scan continuously or will start scanning when presented
        with an object at the scanning aperture, allowing hands-free
        operation. They are generally the preferred option for retail
        use, but are not the cheapest option. They can be recognised by
        the sharp red line, or pattern of lines, emitted when in
        operation.</span></p>
