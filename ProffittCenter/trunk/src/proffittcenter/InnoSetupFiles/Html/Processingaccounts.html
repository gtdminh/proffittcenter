    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">For products that are charged, sell as
        normal and then scan the </span><span class="rvts12">Charged</span><span
        class="rvts9"> barcode or type </span><span class="rvts10">1000034</span><span
        class="rvts9"> followed by the enter key, or use the menu option </span><span
        class="rvts12">Payment&gt;Charge</span><span class="rvts9">. If a
        customer has not been defined, the </span><a target="_top" class="rvts16"
        href="Customers.html">Customers</a><span class="rvts9"> screen &nbsp;is
        displayed. Select the name of the desired customer with the mouse and
        then press the </span><span class="rvts12">OK</span><span class="rvts9">
        button. A new customer entry can be created clicking the </span><a class="rvts16"
        href="Newcustomers.html">New customer</a><span class="rvts9"> button. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Subsequently, accounts must be paid for
        if you are to remain in business. On an empty sales screen, scan the</span><span
        class="rvts12"> Received on account</span><span class="rvts9"> barcode,
        or type </span><span class="rvts10">1000035, or use the menu option </span><span
        class="rvts11">Payment&gt;Received on account</span><span class="rvts10">.
        The </span><span class="rvts11">Customers by name</span><span class="rvts10">
        &nbsp;screen will be displayed to select the correct customer.
        Alternatively, in this screen, a customer account card carrying a
        customer number as a barcode can be scanned, to obviate the need to
        manually select a customer. Then the outstanding balance will be shown
        and any amount may be tendered in cash, card or cheque, to reduce this.
        Any remaining balance will be carried forward. If zero is entered as a
        tender, the sales screen is cleared, allowing for a quick account
        balance check.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The barcodes for charged and received
        on account can be printed out using the &nbsp;option </span><a target="_top"

        class="rvts10">.</span></p>

        (goods out, charged) for </span><span class="rvts11">Charged</span><span
        class="rvts10">. Just press the key wherever you might scan the barcode
        for the function.<br>
      </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">In some situations you do not wish to
        extend credit to a customer but want some provision for the customer to
        pay in advance, and to allow purchases to be deducted from this amount.
        This can be done by the menu option </span><span class="rvts11">Payment&gt;Credit
        customer</span><span class="rvts10">, by scanning the </span><span class="rvts11">Credit
        customer </span><span class="rvts10">barcode or typing 1000043 and then
        pressing Enter. The customer needs a credit limit of zero, if credit is
        not to be extended, once the money is spent. When the customer has a
        positive balance, the figure for balance will appear as a negative
        amount.</span></p>
