    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Offers are desirable as a part
        of the overall offering of any shop. ProffittCenter has a range
        of offers that can be programmed by an owner or manager. Offers
        available are currently divided into two groups. These are</span><a
        class="rvts22" href="../../../../../../Help/Packoffers.html"> </a><a
        class="rvts16" href="Packoffers.html">pack offers</a><span class="rvts9">,
        &nbsp;and</span><a class="rvts22" href="../../../../../../Help/Quantitydiscounts.html">
      </a><a class="rvts16" href="Quantitydiscounts.html">quantity
        discounts</a><span class="rvts9">. Further offer types may be
        added in future versions, creating the prospect of an extremely
        versatile system. The names of the types of offer are not very
        indicative, and a careful study of the implementation is
        necessary, if the offers facility is to be fully utilised.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">There is an interaction between
        offers, and items sold using the @ function (</span><a class="rvts16"
        href="Priceover.html">price over</a><span class="rvts9">) or a </span><a
        class="rvts16" href="Discounts.html">discount</a><span class="rvts9">
        given using the % function. In general, if the reduced price is
        less than the normal price or the offer price, it will be
        maintained. If this is not true, the two different price
        reductions are not combined.</span></p>
