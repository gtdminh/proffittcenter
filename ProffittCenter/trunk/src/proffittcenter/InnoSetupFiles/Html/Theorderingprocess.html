    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Ordering with ProffittCenter
        introduces a number of unique ideas to generate orders with an
        uncanny intelligence. After using the system for some time, one
        really begins to believe that the system knows best. Before that
        time, there is ample opportunity to modify and adapt generated
        orders, so you never loose control.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The first innovation is the
        estimation of the stock level required. It is best to think of
        this with the aid of a concrete example. I will base one on my
        own experience; collecting goods from Booker Cash &amp; Carry,
        three times a week. On Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings,
        and also, occasionally, on Saturday morning. Sunday was our
        busiest day of the week. Clearly, a fixed level for re-ordering
        a product might have worked, but it would be sub-optimal. The
        best answer has to be to look at the past sales record to
        determine future requirements.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The way this is done is
        explained here. Consider going to Bookers on a Wednesday. The
        program knows the stock level when generating the order, and the
        day when fresh stock will be fetched (Friday), after this order
        is collected. It needs to calculate the number that might be
        sold between Wednesday morning and Friday morning, and to order
        a fresh case if this exceeds the number in stock. The best
        estimate of this number to be sold is obtained by looking at how
        many were sold in the same time period during the previous week.
        As this might have been exceptional, the number sold in the same
        time period two and three weeks before is also calculated, and
        the worst case (the maximum) selected. This alone would not have
        any predictive qualities, so in addition to this, three weeks
        from the previous year are selected, centred on the current time
        period, but sticking to the same days of the week. As a result
        of this, items that are seasonal will magically be re-ordered in
        time.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br>
      </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The second innovation is the
        integration or stock-checking with the ordering process. It was
        found in practice that a major reason for errors in orders was
        errors in stock levels. The worst of these is when a case has
        not been entered into the system on the previous delivery. In
        this situation, a second case would be collected, which is not
        only needlessly expensive, but creates shelf-life problems. To
        avoid this, each time an order is created, the stock levels of
        all ordered items should be counted. These levels can be
        corrected on the order form, and if necessary, the item can be
        deleted, or a fresh order generated with the corrected values.
        This has an added benefit in that the levels of stock for items
        that are ordered are generally low so that counting can be done
        quickly, and accurately. Once the levels are checked, the stock
        levels are time stamped, and so will not be included in the next
        regular stock take, so no additional time is taken.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The third innovation is the
        calculation of , or return on capital invested (roci). No other
        EPOS system that we know of will provide this vital figure.
        Yield is the effective return on investment obtained by
        investing in a particular line of stock. If you are ever in the
        position of being limited with the amount of cash that you can
        invest in stock, then common sense dictates that it should be
        invested in stock with the highest . This can be easily done
        with ProffittCenter.The fourth innovation is the calculation of
        a sell by date. This allows for the rejection of any stock at a
        cash and carry that will not be sold completely by it's expire
        date (sell by or use by date in UK).</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">This has all been explained
        with just one example. The process is just as applicable to
        daily milk deliveries, or monthly biscuit orders. Set up the
        supplier defaults correctly, and all situations are dealt with
        correctly. Understanding the ordering system is more complicated
        than with other systems, but is no more complicated to use once
        defaults have been correctly set up. So persevere and you
        business will benefit greatly.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The MinStockLevel in the stock
        record is also now included in the calculations. Do not use this
        as the default for ordering: a value of 1 is sufficient for
        general use.</span></p>
