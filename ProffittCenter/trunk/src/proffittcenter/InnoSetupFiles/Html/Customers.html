    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Select the menu item </span><span
        class="rvts12">Customers</span><span class="rvts9"> and then
        choose between by name, or by &nbsp;number. Customers will be
        listed in the specified order in tabular form. Use the scroll
        bar to move beyond the visible list. Select any line and then
        click the </span><span class="rvts12">Details</span><span class="rvts9">
        button to see customer details. With this selected, the full
        details of the customer with the option to print a new
        membership card for an account is shown. </span><span class="rvts12">Details</span><span
        class="rvts9"> can be altered and then saved by clicking the OK
        button. One option that can be changed is the stop tick box.
        Ticking this will stop further goods being taken by customers
        with unpaid bills. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The same form, sorted by name
        is shown when the customer select number, </span><span class="rvts21">1000380000</span><span
        class="rvts9"> is entered at the sales screen, or a 'charge' or
        'received on account' is requested without first selecting a
        customer. A member can be selected by clicking on a name with
        the mouse and then clicking the OK button; or scanning an
        account button. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Bear in mind that the Data
        Protection Act in the UK, and similar regulations elsewhere, may
        mean that personal data cannot be shared with other customers at
        the counter without the consent of the person involved.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The same form is used to select
        a customer: just scroll through and click on a customer and then
        press the Enter key. You can also scan or type in a Customer
        code followed by Tab or Enter.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">To charge a sale to a customer,
        simply scan the customer barcode at some time during the sale,
        or using </span><span class="rvts12">Customers&gt;Customer by
        name</span><span class="rvts9">, select the customer and then
        press the Enter key. Finally </span><span class="rvts12">Charge</span><span
        class="rvts9"> the customer account by scanning the </span><span
        class="rvts12">Charge</span><span class="rvts9"> barcode or
        typing 1000034 followed by Tab or Enter.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">To refund a customer for
        returned goods, scan as normal and then press the - (minus) key
        followed by the Tab or Enter key. The goods will be returned to
        stock. &nbsp;To return all the items 'sold' so far, press the
        minus key and then holding down the shift key, press Enter.
        Finally charge this to the previously selected customer by
        scanning the </span><span class="rvts12">Charge</span><span class="rvts9">
        barcode.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If at any time the </span><span
        class="rvts12">Charge</span><span class="rvts9"> barcode is
        scanned without selecting a customer, the </span><span class="rvts12">Customers

        by name</span><span class="rvts9"> screen appears and you can
        select a customer at that stage with a mouse followed by the
        Enter key. With the </span><span class="rvts12">Customers by
        name</span><span class="rvts9"> screen visible, it is still
        possible to scan a customer barcode for selection.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">To make a payment off an
        account, with a customer selected, scan the 'Received' barcode
        or type 1000035 followed by Tab or Enter. The account balance
        will be shown as a total, and any amount paid in may be typed
        in. If this is just an enquiry, enter a zero followed by enter.
        It is possible to pay money into an account, when no money is
        owed. Simply press the shift key when pressing the Enter key. To
        return money paid in this way without purchasing goods, do an
        enquiry as above, but then type zero, and then hold the shift
        key down as you press enter.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The screen can also be
        manipulated entirely by keyboard characters: use the up and down
        arrows to move the selection up and down, or the page up and
        page down to jump through the customer names. Use the + sign to
        create a new customer and Control-I key to see customer details
        of a selected customer. If a customer barcode is scanned, this
        is returned as a customer number.</span></p>
