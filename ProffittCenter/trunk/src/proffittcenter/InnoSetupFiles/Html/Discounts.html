    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">A discount can be offered on
        the last item scanned, or any selected item, by typing the
        percentage discount followed by the % symbol </span><span class="rvts10">(or

        alternatively, the character /, which avoids the use of shift
        key,) </span><span class="rvts9">followed by the Enter key. For
        example; a ten percent discount is achieved by just entering
        10%! </span><span class="rvts10">If offers are in affect on the
        discounted product, then any change due to the offer will not be
        applied to a discounted item. &nbsp;If only one item of several
        is to be discounted, then it needs to be on a separate line and
        this needs to be done first..</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">If a whole bill is to be
        discounted, prior to accepting a tender, hold down the shift key
        when pressing enter. So for 10% discount type 10% and press
        shift/Enter and ten per cent discount will be applied to each
        line of the bill.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">If a discounted item is
        subsequently , the discount will be maintained on the item. So
        an item at £10 with at10% discount will sell at £9. If this item
        is subsequently priced over at £5, the 10% discount will be
        applied to this price, making it sell at £4.50. </span><span class="rvts9">These

        operations are restricted to those with the manager or owner
        authority. If the operator does not have authority, a dialog box
        is displayed and an owner/manager can scan their pass to allow
        the discount.</span></p>
