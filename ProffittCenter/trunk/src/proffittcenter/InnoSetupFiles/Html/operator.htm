The Print button is used to print out details, including a bar code using the default printer, suitable for laminating to make a staff pass.
<br>
Printed passes will have a preceding 1000037 so that the pass will be recognised by the <a href="salesscreen.htm">sales screen</a>.
<br>
Once you have created an additional operator, and at least one of these has owner or manager status, you can change the authority of the Default operator to 6.
<br>
In addition, you can allow any operator additional permissions by ticking the appropriate check box.
<br>
In addition, each operator can have privaleges ascribed. This allows a shopkeeper to decide what activities each member of staff can perform on a case by case basis.
<br>
Managers can do all activities except modify Operators, without additional permission.
