    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">When we entered new products
        in the sales screen, we created a temporary product, saving time
        when a customer is waiting. After your first rush of sales, it
        is time to make this temporary product into a more permanent
        one. Temporary products are just products that are assigned to
        the temporary, or default department.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">To convert this temporary
        product to a permanent one, click on the menu selection, </span><a
        class="rvts16" href="Defaultstock.html">Stock&gt;Default stock</a><span
        class="rvts10">.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The first temporary product is
        shown.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Using the mouse, drop down the
        department combo box and select a department. There are no
        departments at present other than the Default one for temporary
        products. This time we first need to create a department for our
        new product. Press the Escape key to clear the screen and the
        select </span><a class="rvts16" href="Departments.html">Tables&gt;Departments</a><span
        class="rvts10"> for a list of available departments. Click the </span><span
        class="rvts11">New</span><span class="rvts10"> button and fill
        in the details in the </span><a class="rvts16" href="Department.html">Department</a><span
        class="rvts10"> screen, tabbing between fields. Leave the
        default minimum at 0. Create an entry for a department to hold
        Ice Cream products, with Standard Rate Tax. When you are done,
        click the OK button. Press the Escape key to clear the </span><span
        class="rvts11">Departments</span><span class="rvts10"> screen,
        as before.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Now go back to </span><span class="rvts11">Default

        stock</span><span class="rvts10">., and this time, select this
        new department for Ice Poles, leaving the SKU (Stock Keeping
        Unit) entry blank. The new SKU screen is displayed. There can be
        more than one product linked to the same SKU.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Entries for the new stock
        dialog have been filled in from the defaults for the department
        chosen. The stock quantity is zero, but this can be changed if
        you wish to reflect the true stock level.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The default settings for the
        ice cream department are for standard rate items (UK). If we
        need to change the VAT, use the drop down box. When this has
        been done, click the OK button with the mouse, or simply use the
        Tab key to step to the OK button and then press the Enter key.
        Then press the Enter key again to accept the remaining </span><span
        class="rvts11">Product</span><span class="rvts10"> screen. If
        there are any more temporary products, these will appear, one by
        one.</span></p>
