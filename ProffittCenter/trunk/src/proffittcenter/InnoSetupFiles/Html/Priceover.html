    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">This feature allows an operator to
        vary the price at the point of sale. The item is sold in the normal way.
        Then enter the price in pence followed by the @ symbol, or alternatively
        the = symbol.</span><span class="rvts10"> On pressing Enter, the selling
        price is adjusted for the current or selected line only. The price of
        the product in the product table is </span><span class="rvts15">not </span><span

        class="rvts10">changed. Any items sold subsequently will be at the
        original price, even during the current sale. If an offer is in use on
        the product, then it will not apply to a priced over item. If only one
        item of several is to be reduced, then it needs to be on a separate
        line, so deal with it first.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">If a negative number is entered, the
        final price will be the original price minus the entered value: say the
        original price is £1.00 and we enter @-15, then the price charged will
        be £1.00 - 15 p = 85p.<br>
      </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">There is interaction between price
        over and . See this section for details.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">This operation is restricted to those
        with the manager or owner authority. If the operator does not have
        authority, a dialog box is displayed and an owner/manager can scan their
        pass to allow the price over.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The maximum price that can be entered
        as a price over is £1200. The price may be increased as well as reduced.
        The need for this might arise if you were to use the program to keep
        track of auction sales in addition to shop sales.</span></p>
