    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">After using the mouse to select
        â€¦ After selecting a supplier, the Order create form will appear.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If the supplier defaults have
        been set up correctly, the next four entries will be set
        correctly and the Enter key can be pressed to start the order
        generation process. If not, then see the &nbsp;page. Pressing
        the OK button will generate an order.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Pressing the Cancel button or
        the Escape key will return immediately to the sales screen
        without generating an order.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The generated order may then be
        examined by selecting &nbsp;on the menu bar.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">As orders are generated based
        on past sales, it is not possible to correctly generate an order
        until there is a past sales history. There should be a minimum
        of three weeks sales records plus the delivery interval; daily
        orders such as milk will give correct results after three weeks
        but orders which are placed monthly will require seven weeks of
        sales history.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The generation of orders can be
        a lengthy process so do not run it from an active station.</span></p>
