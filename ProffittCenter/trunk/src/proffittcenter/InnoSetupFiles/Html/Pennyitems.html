    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Multiple items priced at 1
        penny (UK) are treated slightly differently to others. Say we
        have the key <strong>g</strong> set as a </span><a href="Hotkeys.html"><span
          class="rvts11">Hot key</span></a><span class="rvts10"> for all
        greengrocery sold, each sold at 1p, and we enter<strong> </strong></span><strong><span
          class="rvts11">g35</span></strong><span class="rvts10"> to
        indicate that greengrocery worth 35p has been sold. This is then
        displayed as 1 item at 35p rather than 35 items at 1p. If we
        subsequently try to modify the number sold, say be pressing the
        <strong>Enter </strong>key to increase by one, the number sold
        will increase from 1 to two items at 35p. This representation is
        not restricted to hot keys; any product priced at 1p will be
        treated in the same way. This change was made as customers were
        sometimes confused by the original unmodified display. The use
        of the penny and the pound in these discussions, does not mean
        that the facilities are in any way limited to just this
        currency. ProffittCenter is an international program.</span></p>
