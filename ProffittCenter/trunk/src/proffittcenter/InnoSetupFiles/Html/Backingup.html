    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Facilities are built into
        ProffittCenter to back up the MySQL database to an on-line
        server over the Internet every time you shut down ProffittCenter
        on the computer with the server (mysql database) running on it.
      </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br>
      </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The preferred backing up
        solution is now provided. Just install the free Dropbox
        software, and everything will be taken care of. The Dropbox
        software is available on the Internet - just click on the link
        in the </span><span class="rvts11">Help</span><span class="rvts10">
        menu or on the </span><span class="rvts11">File&gt;Settings
        &gt;Server</span><span class="rvts10"> tab. Not only is this
        solution simpler to get working, it is not necessary to wait
        while a sizable attachment to an email is sent, when shutting
        down at the end of a long day. Dropbox will quietly upload the
        file in the background during the next working day. Files are
        saved with a name that includes the day of the month, ensuring
        that only month-old files are overwritten. Earlier versions are
        available on Dropbox.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts19">In the Settings screen are two
        entries: Backup email address and Backup password. The backup
        email address and password are just the values for a gmail
        account which may be your own or one you have created just to
        hold your backups. The files will have the name tillDumpxx.sql
        where xx is the numeric day of the month. Do not switch off your
        computer until the backing up is complete. This may take some
        time. <br>
      </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts19">Subsequently, a log file of
        any errors is saved locally in My Documents/ProffittCenter
        Reports or alternatively in a Dropbox folder. This is not dated,
        so only one file will be available when you look.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If you ever need to restore the
        database at any time, download the latest backup file from your
        gmail account, or from the Dropbox location, and then run the
        sql file using phpmyadmin, or other database management tool. (I
        always use the free version of Navicat)</span></p>
