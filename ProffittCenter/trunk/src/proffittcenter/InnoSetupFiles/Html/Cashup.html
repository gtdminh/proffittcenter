    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">On selecting <strong>Reports&gt;Cashing
          up</strong>, a display of key figures is shown since the last
        cashing up. These are the total Takings, Charges, Agency sales,
        and the totals for </span><span class="rvts12">Coupons, Debits</span><span
        class="rvts9"> and </span><span class="rvts12">Paid outs</span><span
        class="rvts9">. In addition, the sum of </span><span class="rvts12">Accounts
        charged</span><span class="rvts9"> is shown. These figures will
        include any tax taken. In addition, the start and end date and
        time for the cashing up period (Starting from the last time and
        ending now), and the operator who performed the cashing up. On
        clicking OK, the program closes down. To reconcile the takings,
        the cash, debits,coupons and Paid outs in the till should equal
        to the Takings figure less the Charges plus any Agency sales.
        &nbsp;The figure for the takings for accounting purposes is
        taken from <a href="Takings.html"><strong>Takings </strong></a>screen
        for the given period. The takings are counted and reconciled
        using the &nbsp;screen.</span></p>
