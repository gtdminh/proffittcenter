    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Log in by typing 10000370000
        followed by the Enter key when the program starts.
        (Conveniently, this number is already sitting there, ready for
        you to just press the Enter key.) This will log you in as the
        default operator. Then press the letter 'i' followed by the
        Enter key. The letter i is a . The system will issue an error
        beep for an unrecognised product. Repeat pressing the letter i
        followed by the enter key a second time. This time, the wording
        next to the data entry box changes to 'Enter a description...'.
        By forcing the operator to enter a code twice, ProffittCenter
        avoids the creation of a new product when a bar code is only
        partially read or miss-read. Type in a description of the
        product you want associated with the letter i, for example 'ice
        pole', and press the Tab key. Descriptions are automatically
        capitalised, so that 'ice pole' becomes 'Ice Pole'. The caption
        changes to 'Enter price in pence ..'. As a general rule, all
        prices are entered in pence (or your local smallest currency
        unit, such as cents), just as they would be on a cash register.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Now, after pressing the Tab or
        Enter key again, the first ever item will be shown as sold on
        the screen, and a sales total will be shown on the right.</span></p>
