    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The </span><span class="rvts12">Stocktake</span><span
        class="rvts9"> screen is shown when the menu selection </span><span
        class="rvts12">Stock&gt;Stock take&gt;All</span><span class="rvts9">
        is selected. There are also options for stock taking a single
        product, a department, all stock of a single supplier, all stock
        with a zero, or with a negative level. There is also an option
        to stock take items with a quantity of less than 10. This option
        is sometimes useful as it avoids counting large numbers, as
        mentioned in the previous help page.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The Stock take screen shows a
        table of 26 entries with columns headed </span><span class="rvts12">SKU</span><span
        class="rvts9"> (Stock Keeping Unit), Product, Quantity and Date.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The SKU and Product columns
        show the SKU ID and linked product description. Remember that
        when multiple products are linked by a common stock entry, that
        only one count is maintained. The product description shown is
        the one with the last recorded delivery.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The Quantity column shows the
        recorded stock quantity. Clicking on this column with the
        left-hand mouse button will open this quantity for editing.
        Simply over-type the new value and then press the Enter key. Any
        downward change in stock level will be recorded in the sales
        table as a positive . </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The Date column, which shows
        the date of the last stock take, will then change to the current
        date, and the item will cease to be displayed. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">When all the stock levels have
        been checked, clicking the All Checked button will change all of
        the dates to the current date and close the screen.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The Print button (or Alt P)
        prints the visible table on the default printer whereas the
        function key F10 will print to a receipt printer if fitted. The
        screen is closed after printing. Quit or escape close the screen
        in other cases.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Note that products can only
        appear in the stock take screen if the date they were last
        checked is before today's date. New products that have only been
        created today will not appear unless the quantity was never
        changed from the default of zero. Also &nbsp;and &nbsp;products
        are excluded completely.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">For each option, you can select
        either Default or All; Default will show a screen of 26 items,
        All will show a screen with all items, using scroll bars if
        needed. Use default for preference.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9"><br>

    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">To do a routine stocktake:</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">1 &nbsp;Use Default setting of
        the stocktake screen</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">2 &nbsp;Press Print key to get
        a list of stock</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">3 &nbsp;Check each quantity
        matches or write down correct quantity next to quantity</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">4 &nbsp;Call up same stocktake
        screen - it will show same products</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">5 &nbsp;Correct any wrong
        figures by typing into the quantity column and pressing Enter.
        The line will disappear.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">6 &nbsp;When all corrections
        have been made, press the All checked button. The scree will
        close</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">7 &nbsp;Calling up the same
        screen again will show a different set of products, until they
        have all been checked.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Notes:</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Stock level can change whilst
        counting is taking place, due to sales - this is why the default
        is a better choice than all - it limits the time taken. (default
        shows just 22 products)</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Arrow keys can be used to
        navigate.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Any corrections will appear as
        Losses in the sales table.</span></p>
