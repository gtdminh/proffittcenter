    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Setting up a network is an
        extensive subject and I have not come up with a definitive
        answer. This note is just to relate my own experience.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">1. &nbsp;You need to have a
        network set up with a router. I have a wireless router supplied
        by TalkTalk. The server (main computer) is wired in. The router
        can be reached by typing 192.168.1.1 into the address bar of my
        &nbsp;browser. Everything left on default settings.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">2. &nbsp;Each computer has an
        assigned name. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">3. &nbsp;In your firewall, open
        port 3306 on server on each client machine. This is
        straightforward in Windows firewall.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">4. &nbsp;On the server, bring
        up the XAMPP control panel and make sure that MySQL and Apache
        are both running.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">5. &nbsp;On the server start
        ProffittCenter Pro and use 'localhost' for server name. The
        database name is till, the User name is root, and the password
        is the one you have set.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">6. &nbsp;Make a note of the
        other computer names. Find these by right clicking on My
        Computer and selecting Properties.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">7. &nbsp;On the server, log
        into XAMPP by putting localhost into the address bar of a
        browser, and then start phpMyAdmin.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">8. Under 'Privileges', create a
        new User for each other computer, using the computer name as a
        user name and making a note of the passwords (required).</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">9. Now, in ProffittCenter Pro,
        on each other computer, under Settings, Make the Server name the
        computer name of the server, the User name is the name of the
        current computer, and the password is the one we just created
        for that user name. The database remains till. Check that you
        get a connection.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">10. Well, if everything works,
        your home and dry. If not, please get in touch although you
        should expect to pay for anything more than basic help on this.</span></p>
