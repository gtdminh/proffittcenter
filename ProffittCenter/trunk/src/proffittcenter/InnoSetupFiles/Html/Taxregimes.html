    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">ProffittCenter is in use
        throughout the world. To ensure compatibility with the differing
        tax regimes in use, it is necessary to look at how different
        sales taxes are levied, and to set up ProffittCenter
        accordingly. The tax regime in use is specified in the
        &nbsp;screen. Before rushing to choose an appropriate setting,
        please note that in the absence of any sales taxes, it is still
        necessary to specify a zero rated tax to apply to all products.
        The options for tax regime fall into two groups: the simpler
        sales taxes, and the various value added tax formats. We will
        explain these separately below.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts15">No tax: </span><span class="rvts10">this







        setting is selected when the country of use has no sales taxes.
        Leave a record for one sale tax of zero for filling in the stock
        record for every product and another for rentals, or service
        charges, again with a zero rate.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts15">Sales tax:</span><span class="rvts10">
        this setting is used for countries for a sales tax levied on all
        retail sales. The assumption is that wholesale supplies will
        have no tax levied. Set up one tax record with the desired rate.
        If there are any exempt products, then a separate zero rate is
        required. The tax is applied to a complete bill as a separate
        charge. All product prices exclude this tax. The net takings
        figure will include all sales but will exclude any sales taxes.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts15">VAT:</span><span class="rvts10">
        This is value added tax, used in the European Union. It differs
        from a sales tax because the tax is applied to supplies at
        wholesale price, and this tax paid may then be offset against
        the tax charged on goods sold. The tax is thus charged on the
        addition cost of goods, that is the added value. There are three
        separate cases to consider. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts15">Registered trader: </span><span
        class="rvts10">The normal situation of a registered trader, who
        charges the correct tax on all of their sales but the retail
        price of items includes these taxes. The net tax is not
        displayed to the customer, and is not shown on the receipt.
        Product prices include any tax due, but net takings exclude
        these taxes.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts15">Unregistered trader: </span><span
        class="rvts10">traders whose annual turnover is less than some
        specified amount do not have to collect VAT. As they still have
        to pay VAT on their purchases, and cannot reclaim this element,
        not all tax is lost to their government. In ProffittCenter it is
        necessary to set the correct tax code for each product, so that
        the correct prices are recorded for wholesale prices, and
        margins, etc.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts15">Registered wholesale trader:</span><span
        class="rvts10"> these are registered traders with a main
        customer base are other registered traders. Prices of goods are
        always shown exclusive of VAT, and the tax due is shown on the
        screen and on any receipt. Product prices are recorded exclusive
        of VAT. The net takings figure excludes tax.</span></p>
