    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Customer records are stored for
        one of two purposes. The first is to allow for credit and the
        second to keep track of customers when service or returns are a
        required part of the business. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">New customers can be enrolled
        with the C</span><span class="rvts12">ustomers</span><span class="rvts9">
        menu selection </span><span class="rvts10">and then clicking </span><span
        class="rvts11">New</span><span class="rvts10">. </span><span class="rvts9">Customer

        numbers by default start at 1000380001, upwards. </span><span class="rvts10">The

        customer number is filled in automatically. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The details of existing
        customers can be viewed by selecting and then clicking the </span><span
        class="rvts11">Details </span><span class="rvts10">button</span><span
        class="rvts11">.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">This will be used later to
        allow account cards to be scanned into the sales screen. The
        fields can be stepped through using the Tab key. Names, street
        names etc. are capitalised on exit. There is provision for two
        telephone numbers, and </span><span class="rvts10">provision
        for a second card holder with a different name</span><span class="rvts9">.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The print bar code button
        allows a membership card to be printed. The print is onto the
        default printer, using a small note size piece of paper. After
        being signed, this can be folded in half, trimmed with scissors,
        and then sealed with a credit card size laminating machine. The
        use of heat sealing to laminate the card stops a thermal receipt
        printer being used, so the cards are printed on the default
        printer.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The details to be filled in
        are self explanatory. All entries will be capitalised, so stick
        to lower case for maximum convenience. </span></p>
