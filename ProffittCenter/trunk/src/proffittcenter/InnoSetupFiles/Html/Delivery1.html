<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The </span><span class="rvts11">Delivery</span><span class="rvts10"> screen appears after selecting a delivery in the </span><span class="rvts11">Deliveries</span><span class="rvts10"> screen and pressing the details button. It shows a table of stock that has been delivered and then entered via the </span><span class="rvts11">Delivery entry</span><span class="rvts10"> screen. A running total of the total cost of items listed is shown, and the operator can enter the equivalent total from an invoice in the 'Invoice total' box. The same is true for tax. There is also a 'Completed' checkbox to show that the delivery has been fully dealt with. When the default OK button is clicked, these values are saved.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">If wholesale prices are entered during delivery entry, these are shown as Invoice total when the screen is opened. There will be times when the true price is not known when the delivery is received, and the prices entered will be the previous price, the price calculated using the default margin, or zero. In the delivery screen, prices can be corrected and ultimately, the two sets of figures should tally. Remember to operate the OK (tick) button to save any changes.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Note that completed deliveries will no longer appear as a choice when </span><span class="rvts11">Delivery entry</span><span class="rvts10"> is attempted.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">At the top of the screen are buttons that can change the retail and wholesale (pack) price of the selected delivery line by clicking the appropriate button and then making the change. This allows for the correction of entries in line with the invoice, when this is delivered at a later date.</span></p>
