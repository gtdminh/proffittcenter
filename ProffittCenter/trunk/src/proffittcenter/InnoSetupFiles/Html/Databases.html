    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">When starting with an empty
        database, it is necessary to create some entries before the
        system is of any use. Products are created on the fly by the
        sales screen, but if not defined at the time, they are created
        with the temporary SKU assignment, </span><span class="rvts12">Default</span><span
        class="rvts9">.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">To make record creation
        simpler, some entries are left in the empty database, such as
        VAT rates, and Departments. These can be modified, deleted and
        added to as required, but it is important that this is done
        before adding stock and product records. Once a record is
        referred to by one of these, it can no longer be deleted. The
        Stock database is left with two entries called Default and TempB
        for temporary assignments to zero rated and standard rated
        stock. The first entry is required by the system and should
        never be deleted. The Department database is set up with
        departments. These can be deleted or modified, but three must
        remain. These are </span><span class="rvts12">Default</span><span
        class="rvts9"> and </span><span class="rvts12">Agency</span><span
        class="rvts9">. </span><span class="rvts12">Agency</span><span
        class="rvts9"> covers money taken for a third party such as
        PayPoint. The program uses these two.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Similarly, once a sales record
        refers to a product, the product can no longer be deleted.</span></p>
