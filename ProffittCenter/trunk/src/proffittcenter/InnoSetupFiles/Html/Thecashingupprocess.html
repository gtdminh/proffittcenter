    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">At the end of each operator's
        shift, the money in the cash drawer needs to be checked. The
        standard process for this is for the operator to use the menu
        option <strong>Reports|Cash up</strong>. A short printout is
        issued from the receipt printer and the cash drawer will open.
        This should be placed together with the cash for subsequent
        reconciliation. This can either be in a separable cash tray, or
        in a bag or other suitable device.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Subsequently, the person
        responsible for cash should reconcile the cash amounts. They
        select the menu option <strong>Reports|Reconcile cashups</strong>
        and select the Cashup ID on the printout with the money from the
        list displayed. Then, after clicking the OK button, the money
        can be counted and the counts entered into the left hand column
        of boxes, as appropriate using the Tab key to step from box to
        box. The values can be typed in. When all of these amounts have
        been entered, click the <strong>Calculate </strong>button.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The error in the cash amount
        is shown together with lists of <strong>Debits</strong>, <strong>Cheques</strong>,
        <strong>Coupons</strong>, <strong>Received on account</strong>
        and <strong>Paid outs</strong>, and their totals. Check these
        all against the paperwork that should be with the cash. Any
        errors should be entered into the totals boxes for record. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Finally click the <strong>Save

        </strong>button. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">For the <strong>Float </strong>-
        the cash put into the cash drawer at the start of a shift, there
        are two options. The first is to set the 'Float value' on the
        settings screen to some value in pence; so for a £25 float, set
        the value to 2,500. It is then expected that the float will be
        £25 every time the cashing up process is started. The second
        option is for the 'Float value' to be set to zero. When this is
        the case, at the start of a shift, the operator will be asked to
        enter the float value, in pence. Once this has been done,
        operators will not be asked again until 'Reports|Cash up' is
        activated. This is true even if the operators change during the
        day.</span></p>
