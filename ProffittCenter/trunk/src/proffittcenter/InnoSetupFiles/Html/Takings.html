    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Under the menu heading Reports
        are a number of different reports. The first of these is
        Takings. This screen allows for a calculation of takings by
        daily, weekly, monthly or yearly periods.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">To use it simply, choose the
        period, (daily, weekly, monthly or yearly) by clicking on the
        appropriate tab, then set the start date by clicking on the down
        arrow of the Start date box. This will reveal a small monthly
        calendar. A small left pointing arrow can be clicked to reach
        earlier months. By default, the date is set to the current day
        for the daily page, the current week starting on a Sunday for
        the weekly page, the current month starting on the first day for
        the monthly page and the current year starting on the first of
        January.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Then choose a department by
        clicking on the down arrow of the Department box and selecting a
        department. This allows calculation of the trade for any
        specific department to be determined. The next drop down box
        allows for the selection of a specific product within the
        department, for detailed analysis. Calculations can be done
        retrospectively for multiple periods, such as each month for the
        past year.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Then click on the Calculate
        button. The takings for the day, week, month or year will be
        calculated and displayed. When earlier dates are selected, more
        than one row of results will appear.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">When completed, as shown by the
        cursor reverting from an hourglass to a pointer, the results can
        be printed, by clicking the Print button. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Sometimes the calculations are
        quite lengthy but even if incomplete, the screen can always be
        cancelled by clicking the Cancel button or by pressing the
        Escape key.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">All results exclude VAT except
        for the Sales column, which is gross. The Profit column is based
        on the current purchase price so will not be truly accurate if
        historical figures are calculated. Own use sales are based at
        wholesale purchase price. Returns and Losses refer to the
        selected department only. Agency takings are excluded from all
        takings figures. The columns for returns, wastes, etc. refer
        only to a selected department and not all sales.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If your interest is in the
        performance of a particular product or department over time,
        then using the desired interval, choose the page: monthly sale
        are generally the most useful. Then choose a starting date, and
        click the Calculate button. When the calculations are completed,
        use the mouse to select the figures of interest by clicking and
        dragging the mouse. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The selected figures will be
        highlighted in blue with standard colouring. Click on the copy
        button and then open up your favourite spread sheet program. I
        have used Excel here. Select a starting point and then paste the
        figures into the spread sheet by pressing Control-V' key
        combination (or clicking the paste icon). A few steps more and
        the results can be converted into a graph of sales. Here showing
        an uncharacteristic rise.</span><span class="rvts24"> </span></p>

    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">This has now been transferred

        reports menu.</span></p>
