        pence</span><span class="rvts10"> message to be displayed, when
        sold. This does not change the price of the product permanently;
        just the price for this sale. Such items can be used for goods
        which are counted for stock control, but which do not have a
        fixed price. Loose cut cheese might be an example. Price encoded
        bar codes are a better solution, where this is possible. Another
        example would be live (aquarium) fish which are charged an
        amount depending on their size. Barcodes are not practical,
        here.</span></p>
