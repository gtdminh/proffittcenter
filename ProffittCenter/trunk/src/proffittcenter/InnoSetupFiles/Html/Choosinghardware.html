    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The minimum hardware
        requirements are a standard PC with a processor speed of 300MHz
        or greater, with keyboard, monitor, simple sound system and
        mouse; and a standard ink jet printer, for reports. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">To this, you should add a laser
        hands free scanner, to read in the bar codes. Choose one with a
        USB interface. CCD scanners are a cheaper option, but can be
        tedious to use in practice, as they need to be held at the
        correct distance from the bar code, and generally require a
        trigger button to be pressed which precludes hands-free
        operation. They are also unsuitable for reading the larger case
        codes used in the </span><a class="rvts16" href="file:///C:/Users/Dave/Documents/NetBeansProjects/ProffittCenter/src/proffittcenter/InnoSetupFiles/Html/Deliveryentry.html">Delivery



        entry</a><span class="rvts9"> screen.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Most practical situations would
        require the addition of a receipt printer and cash drawer. We
        recommend a serial thermal receipt printer, which is fast, quiet
        and can include an automatic paper cut-off mechanism. Cash
        drawers attach to an outlet at the back of the receipt printer.
        An ink jet printer will still be required for reports. A receipt
        printer is required to print off lists for stock counting.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">A customer pole display is a
        useful addition. One with </span><span class="rvts12">pass-thru</span><span
        class="rvts9"> for a serial receipt printer is ideal.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">There is no need to locate and
        install Windows drivers for your receipt printer or scanner, as
        they are not used by the program and can interfere with normal
        operation. Supported printers are selected in the &nbsp;screen,
        reached from the file menu. Set the printer and pole display to
        ESC/POS emulation. The drive program is included within the
        program.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If buying a computer, choose a
        processor speed of at least 1GHz and with the current low memory
        prices, at very least 2GB of RAM. A hard disk needs to be at
        least 20GB and preferably 100GB. A 19-inch LCD monitor is
        recommended. A CD R/W drive is definitely desirable for backups
        or a memory stick can be used.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">An Internet connection is
        needed for updates to the program and for e-mail support or for
        accessing an on-line database. Future extensions with exciting
        possibilities may require access to the Internet. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">We can supply extension kits to
        convert your existing computer or complete turnkey systems,
        pre-loaded with ProffittCenter for maximum convenience. See the
        web site at </span><span class="rvts14">www.proffittcenter.org</span><span
        class="rvts9"> for the latest prices.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The program was developed to
        run originally on Windows XP but should run on other Windows
        operating systems. The installer is windows specific. Try
        WebStart or download the jar file for other operating systems.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">It is hoped to offer a linux
        version at a later date.</span></p>
