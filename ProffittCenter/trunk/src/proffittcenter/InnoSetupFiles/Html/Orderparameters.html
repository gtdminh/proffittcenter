    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Days spare: this is the leeway
        in stock held. If trade never varied, this could be set to zero
        to guarantee that enough stock was held to meet all
        requirements. Even if customers were that reliable, it would
        mean that trade could never increase. Some experiment may be
        necessary but the default value of one day is a starting point.
        Keeping to this value for perishable stock will minimise waste;
        a higher value for stock with a long life and infrequent
        delivery will reduce out of stocks. It may be beneficial in some
        circumstances to increase this. We found that with boxed cakes
        being delivered on a fortnightly cycle, that on the second week
        the selection was very &nbsp;poor. While this might be optimal
        as far as stock is concerned, customers purchasing cake expect a
        reasonable selection. We found we could increase the days spare
        stock to seven without seriously affecting waste. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Delivery date: This is the date
        of the next delivery. Next delivery date: this is the date of
        the next delivery date after the delivery date. For instance, if
        going to Cash &amp; Carry on a Wednesday morning, and intending
        to go again on Friday, enter the date for Friday. This is
        because we need to calculate how much stock to buy on Wednesday,
        to last through until Friday.</span></p>
