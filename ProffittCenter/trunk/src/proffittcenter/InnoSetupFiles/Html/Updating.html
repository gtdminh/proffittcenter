    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">ProffittCenter is open source
        which has the particular advantage that program updates never
        add to the cost of ownership. This means that you benefit from
        the constantly improving program and its developments.
        Installing the latest version will have no effect on the
        database, which is a separate program (MySQL). &nbsp;Just
        download the latest version periodically, and then install as
        you did the first time around. There is no need to uninstall
        before doing this. The 'jasper' files located in
        ProffittCenterReports are not overwritten. This is so that you
        can modify these files using the open source iReport program,
        and your modifications will not be overwritten. You might need
        to do this to get a different layout of invoices. If on the
        other hand, you find one of the reports lacking, just delete the
        particular jasper files and on install, they will be replaced by
        the latest version.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">If you email Dave at
        proffittcenter@gmail.com with a request, he will share a folder
        in Dropbox that will always hold the latest version of
        ProffittCenter, ready for you to install.</span></p>
