    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">In all locations where a
        product bar code is expected, entering three or more characters
        will bring up the Alpha Lookup screen. For this to work, all
        characters have to be alphabetic characters. The Alpha Lookup
        screen will show a list of matching product descriptions.
        Entering more characters can further restrict the search. It is
        not necessary to type in the starting characters of the first
        word, as the match is performed of each word in the product
        description. So typing bleach may result in a list including </span><span

        class="rvts12">HS Bleach 1l, HS Thick Bleach 1l, Domestos Bleach
        1.5l and Bleach, Value 1l.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Products can be selected with
        the mouse or by using the up/down arrow keys. The typed
        description will then be replaced by the product bar code. The
        last column contains a single digit, 0 to 9. If this digit is
        pressed, that line will be selected. If there are more than ten
        lines, the remainder are not numbered.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Each line of the display
        contains a retail price. This allows for the correct selection
        of products with identical descriptions but different prices.
        The next one to the end of the line, after the product
        description, shows the number in stock. It is often the most
        convenient way of checking the current stock holding, from the
        sales screen; useful for answering customer requests. Pressing
        Escape will abort the lookup, afterwards. The product code
        (barcode) is also shown to distinguish similarly named products.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Products that have their </span><span

        class="rvts12">Stock type</span><span class="rvts9"> set to </span><span

        class="rvts12">Stop</span><span class="rvts9"> are not included
        in the selection shown. This is a useful feature to remove
        products that are no longer being sold from the alpha display.</span></p>
