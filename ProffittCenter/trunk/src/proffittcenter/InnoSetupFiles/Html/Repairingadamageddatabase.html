    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">There are occasions when
        databases get damaged. This usually means that the various
        indexes are no longer in step with the data in the table. In
        most cases, the damage can be recoverable. There are many free
        tools available to perform this work with a MySQL database. You
        should investigate these before committing many hours to
        creating data. Of course, the latest backup can be installed but
        there is certain to be some data lost with a daily backup.</span></p>
