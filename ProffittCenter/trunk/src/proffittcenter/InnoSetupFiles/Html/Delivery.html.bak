    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The </span><span class="rvts11">Delivery</span><span
        class="rvts10"> screen appears after selecting a delivery in the
      </span><span class="rvts11">Deliveries</span><span class="rvts10">
        screen and pressing the details button. It shows a table of
        stock that has been delivered and then entered via the </span><span
        class="rvts11">Delivery entry</span><span class="rvts10">
        screen. A running total of the cost of items listed is shown,
        and the operator can enter the equivalent total from an invoice
        in the </span><span class="rvts11">Invoice total</span><span class="rvts10">
        box. The same is true for tax. There is also a </span><span class="rvts11">Completed</span><span
        class="rvts10"> checkbox to show that the delivery has been
        fully dealt with. When the default </span><span class="rvts11">OK</span><span
        class="rvts10"> button is clicked, these values are saved.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">If wholesale prices are
        entered during delivery entry, these are shown as Invoice total
        when the screen is opened. There will be times when the true
        price is not known when the delivery is received, and the prices
        entered will be the previous price, the price calculated using
        the default margin, or zero. In the delivery screen, prices can
        be corrected and ultimately, the two sets of figures should
        tally. Remember to operate the </span><span class="rvts11">OK</span><span
        class="rvts10"> (tick) button to save any changes.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Note that completed deliveries
        will no longer appear as a choice when </span><span class="rvts11">Delivery

        entry</span><span class="rvts10"> is attempted.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">At the top of the screen are
        buttons that can change the retail and wholesale (pack) price of
        the selected delivery line by clicking the appropriate button
        and then making the change. This allows for the correction of
        entries in line with the invoice, when the invoice is received
        at a later date.</span></p>
