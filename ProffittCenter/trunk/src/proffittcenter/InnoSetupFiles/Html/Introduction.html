    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Welcome to the world of EPOS
        (Electronics at the Point Of Sale), or just plain old POS in the
        USA.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Most retailers will have
        considered EPOS as an essential step towards an efficient,
        controlled retail operation. The next decision then is to decide
        which system. On thinking about priorities, help and maintenance
        will undoubtedly figure prominently. Cost, although an important
        consideration, is rarely a deciding factor.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Why then, do so many people
        choose ProffittCenter? There is no simple answer. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">If you just want a buy it and
        forget it EPOS, then buying your preferred wholesaler's choice
        will seem to suit your needs perfectly. Integration with the
        wholesaler's head office, twenty four hour support and a helpful
        team that will set up your product file and do an initial stock
        take. Of course this service is necessarily expensive, but why
        not? What have you to loose? </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Well cash! The only reason to
        install EPOS is to make more of it. Even if you are only
        thinking of saving time, this will equate to money saved. The
        hard fact is that to save money, and to make more money with
        EPOS, you have to invest your own time as well as your own
        money. Lots of it.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">So the buy it and forget
        approach without the full commitment of the owner, will
        necessarily fail. It will cost them money, instead of making
        any. Maintaining the accuracy of you database will have to
        become your major concern from the moment you bring EPOS into
        your store. How is this different with ProffittCenter and a more
        go-it-alone approach? Well, you will spend more time getting to
        grips with your system, but ultimately, this is time well spent.
        The better your understanding of the program, the greater the
        benefits. So explore the help files diligently, making sure that
        you understand every procedure. Clean up erroneous data as soon
        as you spot it. Regularly keep backups and learn how to repair
        database errors. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Help is still available, both
        by email at </span><span class="rvts11">proffittcenter@gmail.com</span><span

        resource, both for answering new problems, and for scanning past
        problems and their solutions.</span></p>
