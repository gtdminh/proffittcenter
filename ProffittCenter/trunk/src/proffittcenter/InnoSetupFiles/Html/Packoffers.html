    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Pack offers are offers that
        apply to one or more products, where a discount is offered
        whenever a specified number of items are sold. This is best
        clarified by a few examples. Suppose we wish to sell four packs
        of Stella at a discount of 20p from the cost of four individual
        cans. This equates to 5p a can. However, if five cans are
        purchased, there is no discount given on the fifth can. If a
        discount were to be required on the fifth can, then a quantity
        discount is the required offer type. Another example would be
        the offer of buying any four bars from a range of six chocolate
        bars for a pound. This can be applied by giving an offer price
        of 25p to each of the six products. A range of products can be
        selected for the offer. Consider a cat food - there might be a
        range of six flavours all covered by the same offer.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">To set up a pack offer, choose
        the menu selection Offers|Create and then choose Pack offer in
        the drop down box.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The required first product is
        scanned, or the alpha lookup function used. Pressing tab moves
        the focus to the quantity for the offer and then the limit.
        Leave the limit as zero if there is no limit. Limit values do
        not stop the sale of more items - they limit the number of items
        that can be bought at a discount. Additional items are sold at
        the full price. The normal price will be filled in when enter is
        pressed.. The offer price will be the price for the pack. In the
        example of the bars of chocolate above, this would be Â£1. Next,
        the start and end dates are selected by means of a drop down
        calendars. Offers only have effect between these dates. If more
        than one product is required for the offer, click the Add button
        (or type + in the product box) and then enter the additional
        product. It is not then be necessary to set a price for the
        offer. The offer will be automatically inactivated on the day
        after the end date. </span></p>
