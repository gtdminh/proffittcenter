    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">There is sometimes a need to
        have multipacks and single packs linked to a single SKU. If this
        is not done, then it is necessary to book out the multipack and
        treat the individual items as a fresh delivery each time a
        multipack is split for resale.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Let us for example consider
        Stella Artois cans sold singly at £1 each. You could also sell
        whole cases (24 cans) at £22 a case. The case would be
        recognised by the case barcode. We are not discussing offers
        here. The singles and cases are treated as different products
        being sold at different prices. What we require is for the stock
        level of Stella cans to be reduced by 24 every time a case is
        sold.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">This is achieved by changing
        the multipack quantity from its' default value of 1 to 24 in the
        New Product dialog. As this makes no sense, unless the product
        is linked to an existing product, a link must also be made in
        the SKU drop down box before this can be effected.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Note that when stocktaking, it
        is now the number of cans of Stella that will be counted, even
        if whole cases are held.</span></p>
