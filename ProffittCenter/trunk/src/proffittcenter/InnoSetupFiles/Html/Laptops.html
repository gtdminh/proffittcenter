    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">A laptop may also be used to
        run the system. This has the immediate advantage of being able
        to continue working after a power failure. It also leads to a
        compact counter-top solution.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">We would recommend a USB
        scanner and serial printer. A single line scanner should be able
        to run off the laptop's power supply. The receipt printer will
        require mains input, but it will be possible to continue working
        without receipts. A second display may be connected for customer
        use, mirroring the laptop's screen. This can also be achieved
        with a television screen with the appropriate connecting leads.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Some changes have been made to
        accommodate the limited keyboard of a laptop. In particular, the
        .n instead of *n for a multiplier avoids the use of the shift
        key. Some users have added a USB numeric keypad for convenience.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">If your laptop lacks a serial
        port, you can experiment with a USB to serial converter.</span></p>
