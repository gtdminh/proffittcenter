    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Having acquired free software,
        some retailers have built successful systems using only
        second-hand equipment for the ultimate in a low cost approach.
        There is little to fault with this approach. Much of the
        equipment available has years of useful life left, and there is
        a steady supply of equipment, due to shop closures and
        liquidations. (EPOS didn't stop them failing!)</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Receipt printers are available
        with either dot matrix or thermal mechanisms. Dot matrix types
        are noisier and will occasionally need a new ribbon, whereas
        thermal printers need special, but readily available paper; but
        both are usable. Interfaces are currently serial, or parallel,
        but USB is available on newer units. The program can accept
        either serial or parallel. USB may present a problem. The
        program can accept Epson ESC/POS standard. Other widths can be
        catered for by adjusting the characters to a line setting in the
        settings screen. Printers are often set up by internal dip
        switches. To test current settings, press and hold the Form Feed
        switch while switching on the printer and it should print out a
        test strip together with information that will show the
        settings. A printer manual can often be downloaded from the
        Internet, but in the absence of this, you could try adjusting
        switch setting by trial and error. A serial printer should be
        set to 8 bits, no parity, dtr/dsr, 9600 baud and one stop bit.
        Note that you will require a serial printer cable and not a null
        modem cable.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Scanners can be keyboard
        wedge, (a Y-shaped lead that sits between computer and
        keyboard,) serial, or USB interface. See the &nbsp;on setting up
        a serial scanner. If the scanner works for your products, fine.
        If not, you may need to re-program it. First locate the manual
        on the Internet, and print it. If your scanner is too old to be
        supported, download a later scanner by the same manufacturer and
        try using that one. Scanners are programmed by scanning special
        bar codes printed in their manual. You need to program it to
        read type 39 codes (or 3of 9) and the various EAN and UPC codes
        on offer. Default settings are commonly acceptable, but changing
        such things as inter-character delay can be helpful.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Cash drawers are generally
        compatible, and plug into the back of the receipt printer. Make
        sure that you have the correct lead, as they are not too readily
        available. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">New equipment is also to be
        recommended. New receipt printers will have a drop in facility
        for paper; this is very useful if you have a customer waiting
        for a receipt. ProffittCenter can supply recommended compatible
        equipment so visit the web site at www.proffittcenter.org for
        current hardware prices. </span></p>
