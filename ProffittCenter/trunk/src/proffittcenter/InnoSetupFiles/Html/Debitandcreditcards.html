    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Debit and credit cards may be accepted
        in payment of a sale by pressing the function key F5 or by selecting
        Payment|Debit with the mouse. A minimum amount of £5 by default, or to
        the value set in the <a target="_top" href="Settings.html">Settings </a>screen,
        is required. If this condition is not met, then a warning message is
        displayed.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps8"><span class="rvts9"> </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The dialog that appears shows the total
        to be paid. Stepping on to the next entry by pressing the Tab key moves
        to the Cash back drop down box. This may be activated by left clicking
        the mouse or by using the Down Arrow key. Cash back of 5, 10, 15 or 20
        (£) is allowed. Remember that cash back is not allowed with credit
        cards. When your separate PDQ or other terminal accepts the card, press
        Tab key twice more to accept the payment. Pressing Escape aborts the
        payment method.</span></p>

        acceptable for PayPoint or other <a target="_top" href="Billpayments.html">agency
          payments</a> if these form a part of the sale. This restriction, and
        the minimum transaction value, can be overridden by pressing the shift
        key while selecting the debit payment option on the menu bar with the
        mouse, if the operator has owner or manager authority.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">There is no minimum set for refunds on
        debit or credit cards.</span></p>
