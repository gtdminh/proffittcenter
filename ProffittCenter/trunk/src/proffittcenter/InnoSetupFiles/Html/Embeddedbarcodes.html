    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Some barcodes have the price or the
        weight encoded in the barcode; for a detailed description of this, see
        WikiAnswers. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The most common formats are:</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">UPC-A: 2IIIIIVPPPPC</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">UPC-B &amp; EAN-13: 02IIIIIVPPPPC</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">In these formats the "02" or "2" are
        the left-most digits of barcode. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The 'I' characters are the item code,
        and the 'P' characters are the price or weight codes. The 'V' and 'C'
        are check digits. In South Africa we have found that the price can be
        encoded as 5 digits - the V being the extra digit for price encoding.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">It is not possible to enter such codes
        at the sales screen like other products, but if such a code is scanned
        into the 'New product' screen either from delivery or starting stock
        screens, then there is automatically an additional option available - to
        choose encoded by weight or by price. When one of these is chosen, the
        barcode is stripped down to the initial digits and then the rest
        replaced with zeroes. With price encoded products, the price entry is
        not relevant and a zero will be stored. For weight encoded products, the
        weight is specified in grams and the price entered should be the price
        per kilogram.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The encoded products can be examined
        in the 'Table|Encoded products' screen.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">When sold via the sales screen, the
        normal actions of the Enter key to increase quantity by one, and to
        multiply by n by typing *n, do not work. Such products should always be
        scanned singly.</span></p>
