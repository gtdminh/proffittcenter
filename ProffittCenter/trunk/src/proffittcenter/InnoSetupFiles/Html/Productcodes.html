    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">ProffittCenter makes use of a
        number of special codes, or numbers, to implement functions such
        as &nbsp;or . A consequence of this is that these numbers may
        not be used for products. This is no problem if product Bar
        codes are used, as all legal EAN or UPC Bar codes are
        acceptable; but it does need to be considered if product codes
        are created for your own use.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Small numbers, up to 129,999
        are interpreted as a cash tender (i.e. Â£1299.99), so these
        numbers may not be used. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Ten digit numbers that begin
        with 1000030 to 1000039 are used internally and should not be
        allocated as product codes. To allow for some further
        extensions, this range of restricted numbers should be extended
        to a maximum of 1000399999.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The numbers 1000001 to 1000026
        are interpreted as s, product codes generated by pressing a
        single character on the keyboard. These are legal codes, but you
        should be aware of their interpretation.</span></p>

        details of invented bar code for internal use. </span></p>
