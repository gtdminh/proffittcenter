    <h1><span class="header">Why free software?</span></h1>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Common questions asked are "Why
        is the software free?" and "If the software is really free, what
        guarantees do I get?"</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The software is free because it
        was originally written just for use in our own small shop, and
        then we offered it to other retailers to let them share in the
        benefits, without any immediate thought of profit. For this, the
        program had to be slowly upgraded to a more professional
        standard with such extras as full help files, installation
        routines, etc. Distribution led to the need for a web site. The
        costs involved have meant creating a business around the
        product, making a profit from the sale of hardware. We hope that
        you will purchase the hardware from us so that we can continue
        to provide the service, but it is not required that you purchase
        anything to use the program.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The guarantees provided with
        commercial software are strictly limited. All software licenses
        attempt to take away the right to a refund in any circumstances
        and accept no liability for consequential damage. New enhanced
        versions are normally charged for at the full, or a substantial
        upgrade cost.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Most, but not all, firms will
        offer installation support for a limited period. After that, all
        support is charged for, normally on an annual basis. If for any
        reason a firm stops trading, or sometimes if it just drops the
        product line, any support will normally cease.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The guarantee supplied with
        free software under the GPL license makes no additional
        promises, but at least you are assured of your money back if it
        is not suitable! The license also provides for access to the
        source code. This can mean that support can continue, even if
        the supplier ceases to provide it, provided that others take up
        the programming challenge. This has happened with other software
        products released under the same license, and I strongly hope
        that it will eventually happen with ProffittCenter. Upgrades,
        whether small bug fixes or substantially enhanced versions will
        always be free to download. This in turn means that support only
        has to be tailored to the latest download.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">We do provide free e-mail
        support at </span><span class="rvts14">proffittcenter@gmail.com</span><span
        class="rvts9"> for all users of the program. This has been a
        helpful form of feedback for us and has led to many improvements
        being made to the program. Coping with the flow of e-mails has
        not been a problem to date. In fact, the numbers of e-mails has
        decreased, as initial problems have been ironed out.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">We now have a web based
        discussion group, at www.proffittcenter.org , (just click on
        Forums on the website) so post your questions there or browse
        the answers to other people's questions. Subsequently you can
        all lend a hand in helping newcomers overcome their initial
        hurdles.</span></p>
