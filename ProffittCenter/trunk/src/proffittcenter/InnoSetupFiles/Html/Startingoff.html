    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Initially, a blank database
        will be installed. Log in and use the number '10000370000' as a
        password.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">First enter the required
        entries in the </span><a class="rvts16" href="file:///C:/Users/Dave/Documents/NetBeansProjects/ProffittCenter/src/proffittcenter/InnoSetupFiles/Html/Settings.html">Settings</a><span
        class="rvts9"> screen. Then set up the operators of the system.
        It would be better to give users higher numbers and incorporate
        these into bar-coded passes. When this has been done, the
        initial operator can be downgraded to trainee, but make sure
        that at least one operator has an authority of zero.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The menu selection </span><span
        class="rvts12">File&gt;Print barcodes</span><span class="rvts9">
        will print out a set of six bar codes that can be attached to
        the operator side of the monitor to use for returns, wastes, own
        use, video member, charged and received on account.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Next, set up the departments to
        your liking. The existing departments can be deleted or modified
        provided that no sales have been entered. Retain the Rental
        department for rentals, and the Temp A and Temp B departments.
        Another recognized department is Agency. This was used for the
        receipt of PayPoint monies, but might be used for any money
        received that does not form part of the trade's takings. Aim for
        between ten and twenty departments in total. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Finally, the key supplier
        details should be added to the supplier database.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The system can then be used,
        but it may be wise to add the most commonly sold products (such
        as cigarettes and confectionery in a convenience store) first
        using the </span><a class="rvts16" href="file:///C:/Users/Dave/Documents/NetBeansProjects/ProffittCenter/src/proffittcenter/InnoSetupFiles/Html/Startingstock.html">Starting





        stock</a><span class="rvts9"> screen. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">For each new product
        encountered in the </span><a class="rvts16" href="file:///C:/Users/Dave/Documents/NetBeansProjects/ProffittCenter/src/proffittcenter/InnoSetupFiles/Html/Salesscreen.html">Sales





        screen</a><span class="rvts9">, a description and price have to
        be entered immediately to complete a sale.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">However, as the department is
        left at the </span><span class="rvts12">Default</span><span class="rvts9">,
        the product is considered a temporary product. Later, using the
        &nbsp;menu item </span><a class="rvts16" href="file:///C:/Users/Dave/Documents/NetBeansProjects/ProffittCenter/src/proffittcenter/InnoSetupFiles/Html/Defaultstock.html">Stock&gt;Default





        stock</a><span class="rvts9">, the department and stock details
        are added. These details should include default supplier and
        default case size. These defaults will be used later to generate
        the first orders.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">After a few days, new products
        will be rarer. At this stage, all of the stock details can be
        added at the point of sale if desired, and if time allows. At
        this stage, stock taking should be started as a routine
        activity. Use the menu item </span><a class="rvts16" href="file:///C:/Users/Dave/Documents/NetBeansProjects/ProffittCenter/src/proffittcenter/InnoSetupFiles/Html/Stocktake.html">Stock&gt;Stocktake&gt;All</a><span
        class="rvts9">. Later, it is preferable to use the alternative,
      </span><span class="rvts12">Stock&gt;Stocktake&gt;All&lt;10</span><span
        class="rvts9"> &nbsp;menu selection, as this avoids counting
        large numbers of items, which tends to introduce more errors
        than it eliminates.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">After about three weeks, the
        ordering system can be brought into play.</span></p>
