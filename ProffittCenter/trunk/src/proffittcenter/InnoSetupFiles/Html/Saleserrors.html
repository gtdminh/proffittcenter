    A sales record cannot be deleted, but if a sale is completed in
    error, you just need to revert the action of the sale by creating a
    negative sale of the same items. Before scanning each item, type a
    minus sign. When you have scanned all of the items, type a zero
    followed by <strong>Enter </strong>to complete the sale.<br>
    If the original sale was charged to an account, simply charge the
    reverted sale to the same account.<br>
