    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Many users are somewhat
        daunted by the size of the help files, so the following pages
        have been added so that an initial sale can be completed with
        little or no prior knowledge. Once you have followed these
        simple steps a few times, you will be able to dip into the help
        files with other, more complex issues, such as deliveries,
        orders, accounts, etc.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Before starting, you need to
        install . If you have not done this already, download XAMPP via
        the Internet from the Apache Friends website. Make sure that
        MySQL and Apache are running as a service by looking at the
        &nbsp;control panel. Start these services, and ensure that they
        also start on computer start-up.</span></p>
