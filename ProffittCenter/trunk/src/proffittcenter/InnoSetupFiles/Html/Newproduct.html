    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The New Product screen will appear if
        an attempt to sell an unknown product is made using the &nbsp;screen; or
        if an unknown product is placed in a &nbsp;Screen; or if the menu item
        '' is activated and a new product code is scanned in.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The screen will appear with the</span><span
        class="rvts12"> Product ID</span><span class="rvts9"> filled in and the
        focus on the </span><span class="rvts12">Description</span><span class="rvts9">
        box. Type in a convenient description. Remember that the description is
        used in the Alpha lookup so the third character should be a letter or a
        space and not a number. After pressing the Enter key, the focus moves to
        the </span><span class="rvts12">Department</span><span class="rvts9">
        drop down box and the first character of each word in the description is
        capitalised so there is generally no need to enter capitals. Select the
        desired department using the mouse or the up/down arrow keys. After
        pressing the <strong>Enter </strong>key, pressing the down arrow on
        the Stock box will reveal an alphabetically ordered list of all products
        in that department. If the new product is to be linked to one of these,
        select it with the mouse. Products are linked if a common count is to be
        maintained. For instance, a price marked KitKat bar would be linked to
        an unmarked KitKat bar. If it is a totally new product, leave this box
        blank. Then press the <strong>Enter </strong>key and the focus will
        move to the Price box. Enter the price in pence followed by the Enter
        key.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The focus moves to the Priced check
        box. This indicates that, when ticked, that the product is price marked.
        It is ticked by left clicking with the mouse, or by pressing the space
        bar</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The box labelled Per is intended for a
        column Â£xx.xx per metre or similar.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If you continue to press the <strong>
          Enter </strong>key without filling in a department, the product is
        created as a temporary product and the rest of the information can be
        added later with the <a target="_top" href="Startingstock.html"><strong>Starting
            stock</strong></a> screen.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If possible, it is better to fill in
        the details, as this will ensure the correct VAT treatment and stock
        level adjustment when the product is sold. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">When the <strong>Enter </strong>key
        is pressed with the </span><span class="rvts12">Stock</span><span class="rvts9">
        drop-down box blank, the <a target="_top" href="NewSKU.html"><strong>New
            SKU</strong></a> screen will appear.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Pressing the <strong>Quit </strong>button
        or pressing the <strong>Escape </strong>key will return to the
        previous screen without saving any entries.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">There is occasional confusion with
        price &nbsp;- some products appear to have codes that might otherwise be
        price encoded. Products that are encoded can be set to encoded by price
        or encoded by weight but those that are neither can be left as not
        encoded. The encoded state is set prior to displaying the </span><a href="Newproduct.html"><strong><span
            class="rvts12">New product</span></strong></a><span class="rvts9">
        screen. The codes for encoded product are not entirely standard, having
        been set for internal use only. The 8th bit should be a parity bit but
        some implementations make this bit significant for product
        identification. In this case, the Parity check-box should be unchecked
        for encoded products.</span></p>
