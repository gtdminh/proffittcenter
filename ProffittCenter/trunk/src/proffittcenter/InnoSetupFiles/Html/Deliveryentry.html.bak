    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The </span><span class="rvts12">Delivery


        entry</span><span class="rvts9"> screen is accessible either by the menu
        option &nbsp;or by pressing the function key F11.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The </span><span class="rvts12">Select
        supplier</span><span class="rvts9"> dialog is shown first. Select the
        supplier and then press the Enter key to accept.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The </span><span class="rvts12">Select
        delivery</span><span class="rvts9"> dialog then appears. This show a
        list of deliveries, identified by their delivery note numbers. Click on
        one of these and then press Enter or click the OK button. Alternatively,
        if this is a new delivery, type in the delivery note number (or code)
        and then click OK; you will then be asked to enter the (delivery note)
        date.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The </span><span class="rvts12">Delivery


        entry</span><span class="rvts9"> screen then appears.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Then type or scan, the pack code. If
        the pack is recognised, the remaining boxes are filled in, and entry
        moves to the Number of packs box with a default value of one. If more
        than one pack is delivered, type in the number followed by the Enter
        key. If it is not recognised, the system will issue an error beep. Enter
        the code a second time to bring up the &nbsp;screen. Entering the code
        twice avoids the creation of bogus codes when only a partial scan is
        completed. The pack codes entered may be the bar code on the pack, the
        supplier stock code, or an arbitrary code for your convenience. Both
        letters and numbers are acceptable.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">For instance, for milk, we use the set
        of codes pas, 2pas, 4pas for one, two and four pint pasteurised milk.
        For newspapers, we found it convenient to use the single newspaper bar
        code as a pack code for a paper. This has the advantage that one is not
        caught out by new Bar codes at the point of sale. For frozen foods, we
        use the supplier stock codes shown on the invoice. This allows frozen
        food to be placed immediately into the freezer, prior to data entry. If
        an unrecognised code is encountered, it is necessary to retrieve a
        sample from the freezer to obtain the product bar code. For most other
        products, we use the pack bar code. It may not be possible to read this
        with a CCD scanner.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">For most items obtained singly, other
        than milk, we have a policy of always buying in two at a time, as this
        will allow for sales to increase more easily with demand. We then
        entered a 2 before scanning the single item bar code. This scheme is
        extendible to higher numbers. The advantage of this, over just using the
        bar code, is that a common mistake is to scan a bar code after serving a
        customer without first pressing F11. Without the need for a preceding
        digit, the item will be recognised as a sale.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">On pressing the Tab key, the focus
        moves to the Pack price box. Check this value to see if it has changed
        since the last delivery, and if it has, then type in the new wholesale
        price in pence, excluding VAT, followed by the Enter key. (Exclude VAT
        even if you are unregistered.)</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Entry then moves to the Product price
        box. If this has changed, type in the new price in pence, followed by
        the Tab key. If a new price is entered, an option to print a new shelf
        edge label will be offered when you press the Enter key or click the OK
        button. If you answer no, then you will not be offered the choice
        subsequently.<br>
      </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If you wish to maintain the margin
        after a price increase, type in the margin and press the Enter key to
        give a new price at the specified margin.</span><span class="rvts9">
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If the margin is out of range of the
        default department margin, a warning dialog will appear. The mouse can
        be used to go back to the Product price box if a change is needed. If
        not, pressing the Enter key again will enter the data into the database.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The Cancel button will cancel the
        current inputs but leave the screen active while the Quit button or the
        Escape key will return to the sales screen.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">It is permissible to have a Number of
        cases value of zero. This allows the wholesale price to be updated
        without a delivery.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Pressing the Enter key will operate the
        OK button. The delivery is then entered into the delivery table and any
        changes made are updated.</span></p>
