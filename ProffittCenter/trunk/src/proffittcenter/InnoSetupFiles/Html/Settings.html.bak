        style="width: 124px; height: 124px;" checked="true">Settings </div>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The Settings screen is reached by
        activating the menu entry </span><span class="rvts12">File&gt;Settings</span><span
        class="rvts9"> and requires that the operator has owner or manager
        privileges. This screen is also displayed at start-up if no database is
        found. It will normally be the first screen encountered after installing
        the program. If you have not installed MySQL via XAMPP, freely available
        from the "Apache Friends" website, then do this first. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The </span><span class="rvts12">Settings</span><span
        class="rvts9"> screen is divided into three separate tabs: </span><span
        class="rvts12">server</span><span class="rvts9">, </span><span class="rvts12">hardware</span><span
        class="rvts9">, and </span><span class="rvts12">shop</span><span class="rvts9">.
      </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The </span><span class="rvts18">Server</span><span
        class="rvts9"> tab holds all the required settings for connection to a
        database (MySQL). First there is the server name, the database name, the
        MySQL user name and password. The default for these are <em>localhost </em>(for
        a server running on the same computer), <em>till</em>, <em>root </em>and
        <em>blank</em>. These need to match your own set-up of &nbsp;MySQL. For
        an on-line database, we have (for example)</span><span class="rvts12">
        www.proffittcenter.org, proff2_till, proff2_test</span><span class="rvts9">,
        and the password, which needs to be entered twice. </span></p>
    To maintain a regular backup of the database, install the free Dropbox
    program. <span class="rvts20">You can install Dropbox by clicking on the
      link on the Server tab, and following the instructions. Once installed,
      backing up is automatic.</span>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts18">It is always necessary to click the
        'Test connection' button before the main 'OK' button is enabled. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">If an empty database engine is found,
        additional buttons will be enabled on the Server page to install the
        database, and then install all the required tables. These must be
        clicked in turn, before proceeding to the main OK button.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The </span><span class="rvts17">Hardware</span><span
        class="rvts9"> tab hold values for a specific hardware setup. Select an
        available port and then click the 'Test' button to see if the connection
        works. The code table and select font drop down box can be set as
        required. Here, in the UK, the UK setting, and the Page 19 (PC858 EURO)
        setting proved useful. Click 'Touch screen' if you want to use that
        facility. The 'Invoice printer' is for the use of an attached Windows
        printer instead of a receipt printer. (Not recommended)</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The </span><span class="rvts17">Shop</span><span
        class="rvts9"> tab hold values specific to a particular shop, such as
        shop name and address. Note the pound and penny symbols: insert your own
        for local currency. Select the character set Cp850 for a start. </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The tax regime for the UK, the choice
        is between unregistered (for VAT), registered and wholesale registered.
        The difference is that for wholesale, selling prices are quoted
        excluding VAT, and the VAT is added to the total. For retail, VAT is
        included in each price.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Then, there is a check box 'Receipt
        always' and 'Print receipt if greater than:'. Check this if you want a
        receipt to be issued for all transactions, or increase the value from
        zero if you want printed receipts for larger transactions only. You can
        always print receipts on demand by &nbsp;pressing the 'Print Screen'
        key.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts12">Set</span><span class="rvts9"> </span><span
        class="rvts12">Autoclear in minutes</span><span class="rvts9"> refers to
        the locking of the sales screen if left for an extended period. Set the
        value to zero if you do not want this feature. Set the value to -1 if
        you want the screen to lock after every sale.<br>
      </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The 'Float value' allows for a fixed
        float to be set. Leave this at zero and you will be asked to enter the
        float for the shift.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Till ID should be zero for the back
        office, and any low number for sales stations.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Unchecking the </span><a class="rvts16"
        href="file:///C:/Users/Dave/Documents/NetBeansProjects/ProffittCenter/src/proffittcenter/InnoSetupFiles/Html/Newproduct.html">New




        product</a><span class="rvts9"> box will disable the creation of new
        product in the sales screen.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9"><br>
      </span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Remember, if changes are made on any
        page, it is necessary to click the OK button which will save the changed
        values. The program will then shut down and needs to be re-started.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">To set up with an on-line database, the
        following may be helpful.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">I use Lunar hosts as my provider, using
        CPanel.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">In CPanel click on MySQL databases.
        Then click Create New Database and fill in database name.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Then create a user:</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Then add user to the database you
        created:</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">When you click on Add, you get a chance
        to grant privileges for this user's account:</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Having made a note of all the relevant
        values, go to File&gt;Settings on the Server tab:</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Then the normal process will create the
        database and empty tables.</span></p>
