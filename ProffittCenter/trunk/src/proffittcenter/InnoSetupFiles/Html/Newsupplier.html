    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The <strong>New supplier</strong>
        screen is displayed from the </span><a href="Suppliers.html"><strong><span
            class="rvts12">Suppliers</span></strong></a><span class="rvts9"><a
          href="Suppliers.html"><strong> </strong></a>screen by
        clicking the <strong>New </strong>button or by selecting a
        supplier and clicking <strong>Details</strong>. The <strong>Default
          supplier</strong> cannot be modified. The box labelled Weeks
        credit is straightforward. It is used in the calculation of
        yield. Yield is a calculation of return on money invested, and
        clearly, the only money invested that is of concern to retailers
        is their own money.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The box labelled Days to next
        delivery is the number of days between successive deliveries. If
        a supplier delivers just once a week, the entry will be 7. If
        deliveries are more than once a week, leave this entry blank.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The box labelled Days spare
        stock is set to indicate just how much stock will be sitting on
        the shelf just prior to the next delivery. A figure of one is a
        practical minimum, because of the variation in buying patterns
        of customers. Higher values can be of use when suppliers make
        infrequent deliveries. A low figure can only be tolerated with
        accurate stock level figures. Lack of diligence in stocktaking
        can result in products never being ordered.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">The final entries are a row of
        check boxes labelled to represent the days of the week on which
        deliveries are made. For milk deliveries on six days a week,
        Monday to Saturday, simply click on all but the first button.</span></p>
    <p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts9">Note that by setting up the
        entries correctly, the ordering process is almost automatic but
        you may need to modify the order parameters if there is a break
        in the normal routine of deliveries, say for a Public Holiday.</span></p>
